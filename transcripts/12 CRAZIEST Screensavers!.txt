hey Vsauce Michael here with a video

inspired by orange pumpkin seven who

asked me to cover cool screen savers now

at first I was like screen savers modern

monitors don't even need them but then I

sleuth two-round and realized what a

great idea it was there's some amazing

stuff out there and thought further ado

let's get started first sound stream

this screensaver uses your computer's

microphone and three spawns two noises

meet lotsa Ishar zooms in on infinite

illusion drawings the zoom never stops

but stare at it for a while and then

look at a wall or look at your hand

pretty trippy let's move on to something

more utilitarian like clocks word clock

ticks words every second that when read

together tell you the time you can also

choose the more familiar analog clock

Uniqlo is a clothing label that offers a

free screensaver clock that sometimes

turns into this

sette at home as a screensaver that

connects your computer through the

internet to a database of data collected

from the sky your computer and other

computers using the screensaver evaluate

that data looking for patterns and signs

of extraterrestrial life along the same

lines is electric sheep when it begins

your computer communicates with other

computers running the same screensaver

and together all the idle computers pull

their processing power to produce and

render fractal images into impact movies

so what you're looking at is in a way a

bunch of computers collective dream if

you prefer evil computers make it look

like how from 2001 a Space Odyssey and

even if people don't get the reference

they'll at least think you're just doing

super smartypants genius stuff breve

Walker is incredible

it makes creatures out of randomly

generated shapes with randomly assigned

movements the distance a creature can

move is measured and after the first 25

genetic algorithm selects the top movers

and makes them together to form combo

children shapes just like human

reproduction then the new generation is

tested and among those the best

performers are combined three below is a

screensaver that continuously drops

Legos to make cool shapes and while it's

up you can use the arrow keys to

position the pieces yourself I leave you

with some water lots of water turns your

screen into a puddle and rainy day too

soaks your screen like paper so that the

color and ink run so there you go that

was a dozen screen savers I thought were

cool enough I had to share them big

thanks to orange pumpkin 7 for the idea
