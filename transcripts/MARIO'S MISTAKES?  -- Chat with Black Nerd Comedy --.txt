hey Vsauce how are you doing

happy Wednesday we have a special treat

for you today because Mario turned 25

years old last week and I have a

confession to make because of my

troubled childhood I didn't get to learn

enough about Mario but I've got a

special guest here Andre

aka black nerd comedy anyway let me give

him a call

uh-oh what oh sorry I was not looking at

pictures of Kim Kardashian's butt where

we go oh I used to have a dream

Compassion's bottom is my desktop on my

laptop that I would bring in to work I

don't even know why I thought that was a

good idea as we all know Mario turned 25

years old last week so a milestone it's

a quarter of a century of Mario and you

are one of the preeminent Mario fans you

are a Mario historian a Mario lore

expert but yet on this occasion of the

25th birthday you've got some

constructive criticisms for him some

lessons learned just a little bit it's a

little bit this my Turkish ISM as he

gets older it's time for him to say all

right that I did make some mistakes and

I want to take make sure that this

doesn't happen for the next 25 years

that's why I'm here for for that first

off the bat this is one of the first

times that we've had a Mario game with

no Luigi and people freaked out they

were like where where's Luigi at people

were making fake Luigi video screens on

the computer it was like people wanted

Luigi so bad we just weren't used to not

having the Super Mario Brothers to

Fedder Luigi's a plumber he may have

been like Mario I hear you got a new

game will be there sometime between 8

a.m. and 3 p.m. and I just never showed

in addition to not having Luigi this is

also the first game where Princess

Toadstool is referred to as Princess

Peach now apparently she's been Princess

Peach for a long time in Japan but we

have just known her as Princess

Toadstool and there's all of a sudden

her name is peach it was never explained

that she officially get a name change is

she Princess Peach toadstool is like her

full name um you know it's just I

understand later why they had to do it

for games to make them short but it's

like I like Princess Toadstool it sounds

like a royalty I am Princess Toadstool

but I come in Prince

peach I I don't expect you to uh rule

country I expect you to dance on a

stripper pole yeah said it versus Pete

sounds like a stripper name

Wow that is so funny because I was gonna

say that I love Princess Peach so much

better like toadstool I think of fungus

and I think of like poisonous mushrooms

and I think of like little toad guys and

stool which means poop so come on how

could you possibly want a toadstool

I eat peaches I don't rescue them well

wait a minute but probably the weirdest

thing is Yoshi uh who we got to ride so

many times in Super Mario World and then

I'll be that dirty way uh he shows up in

the game after you've beaten the entire

game you have to get all 120 stars get

everything in the game before you can

find him on top of a castle and he talks

to you you don't ride him he gives you a

hundred lives and then he jumps off of

the castle he's at the top of the castle

gives you a hundred lives and it's like

well you have a clicker but I don't need

my one and just commit suicide how is

how is this fun for kids you just showed

you she committed suicide two different

games two completely different elements

but both have the same problem with me

which kind of can be commonly referred

to for me as crap on the back uh both

games feature the main character with

something on their back that for most of

the game you can't get rid of in Super

Mario Sunshine he's wearing this water

pack and he's like shooting water all

over the place or using water to pump up

higher and it's cute for a while but

it's on almost every single level it's

only small little bonus levels where you

don't get to wear it which are the best

parts of the game I want just a game of

that I don't need all of the water

levels and then Luigi's Mansion is the

same thing he just goes in the haunted

house and he's just sucking everything

up with a vacuum that you cannot get off

your back so you can't jump or anything

Wow's Andre it sounds like that would

suck see what I did there

hahaha that's why they pay me the big

bucks and buy big bucks I mean they just

laugh at me I actually bought this game

for my sister because she's got a we

down in Dallas and um they get us back

to the platform feel the scrolling

platform which is what made me feel

scared as a kid about Mario 64 but they

get back to the platform and you can

actually play two player it works out

better but I wouldn't know like are you

freaking kidding me or players at one

time you're welcome sister I Love New

Super Mario Bros Wii it's like it goes

back to the classic Mario platformers

that we all know and love and it's clear

that this is a popular title like it

still it came out last year and it's

still selling it sold more copies than

Super Mario Galaxy 2 which just came out

which got more accolades it just shows

that people love that classic 2d formula

so very few things to complain about I

think the only real problem that I have

um is that there's four players Mario

Luigi and in two tones it's like we have

the entire Nintendo library and you give

me a yellow toad and a blue toad and

this causes a lot of problems lately and

that screen gets pulled far back because

you're like which tone mi I don't know

who I am it gets really confusing this

is a point where I would have accepted

waluigi i would like alright we can have

Mario Luigi Wario and Waluigi I'll

accept it just don't give me a toad come

on the music is great the the flying

with different planets is great the

different types of levels and what you

can do in each of the levels it is

almost perfection there's only two words

that I can say that makes me annoyed at

Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 purple coins

any stage you have to do you've got to

collect purple coins to get your star

you will leave that game in frustration

you a lot a Wii Remote places where we

remote should not be you will be so

incredibly angry because they are just

mean literally literally the stage will

be like this you have to collect a

hundred purple coins in less than two

minutes on platforms that disappear and

reappear as you flip in the air and if

you get hit one time you're dead

go

what do you have a problem with me

Miyamoto get did I anger you too that

push you in a puddle or something as a

kid and don't remember it like you are

like apparently just mad at Americans

when you made these levels because they

are just evil evil purple stage level

they hate you but later on they got rid

of the purple coin mechanic like they

never did it again so he learned from

his mistakes so he did it again he did

it worse are you Andre

this is turning into a terrible birthday

party for Mario okay so what is it I

know what you're thinking Super Mario

Bros 3 best game of all time what could

possibly wrong with it well there is

something wrong with it and if you're a

younger gamer you probably wouldn't know

about it because you've been privileged

to get the this particular feature but

if you had the game originally you did

not have this certain feature but I'm

talking about

oh my video alright so if you guys want

to see that and the rest of this video

it's totally awesome in fact you're

entitled your entire channel is go over
