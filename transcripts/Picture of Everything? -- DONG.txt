This website lets you create a custom
message that takes up the entire page.

You can then share the custom URL with
friends to say something loudly

bigly, but for more things you can do online

now, guys, this is DONG.
The Sound Walk

is like Guitar Hero meets a
side-scrolling platform

meets darkness. You have to press the
right keys to the beat of the music to

overcome obstacles.

URL shorteners are useful, but I prefer URL

elongators, like this one. Enter a
short, easy to remember URL and

convert it into something

awesome like this.
TheHumanSuitcase recommended

Test Pilot, an excellent game where you
have to design your vehicle,

its propulsion and even its controls.
Now,

every time your puny little craft fails,
be sure to tab on over to the Sad

Trombone,

where with 1-click you can feel like a loser.

If you prefer
Christopher Walken's favorite noise,

use MoreCowbell.dj

to have cowbells 
automatically added to any MP3 you

upload. Now, I have yet to be totally
impressed by it, but I believe in what stands for.

Dragonborn3 calmed me down
with Procatinator.com.

Endless giant loops of cats

with fun music. And Superbanito sent me
a colour matching

game, where you have to find the right color
and eventually move onto tasks

like locating complementary colours.
In Gravity Duck you have to switch

gravity's direction to stay safe.

And doing poses like these allow album
artwork to extend in the real life,

you can check them out at SleeveFace.com.

Symon is an eery point-and-clicking, where you
explore your own dreams

and try to understand their
"doesn't quite make sense"

logic. And if you prefer everything,
Howard Hallis

has drawn it. Jensmalm showed me a
210 square foot picture of everything.

It took years to draw and contains
thousands of characters, celebrities,

memes.

It's got every single Pokemon and,
although Howard doesn't want to be

famous for this reason,

because he drew Waldo into it, it has become the

largest "Where's Waldo?" image ever made by a man.

Oh and here is something.
MoanMyIP

displays your device's Internet Protocol address

while girls sensually moan it.

Now, if you want weird stuff, Overthemoon206 sent me this playlist of

ilogically

awesome comedy and art. It's not scientific
or educational or anything, but it contains a

lot of cool channel 101 stuff

and more. And finally, Kevin showed me
OverAnalyzers yesterday, which I

promptly watched

all of. A bunch of brilliant researchers sent around
trying to figure out things like,

"where did the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
get the money they

used to buy pizza?" or
"how could Batman and Robin have gotten dressed

while sliding down a fireman's pole?"
Well, I've got a playlist of their episodes in the

description, where links to

everything can be found.

And as always,

thanks for watching.

One more thing. If you're tired of your
boring, simple

email address, why not go to this site?
For free,

you can set up a new email address with
what is most likely the longest

possible address?
For instance, I made

this one. Seriously.
