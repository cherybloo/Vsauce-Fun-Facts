a family photo that's not at all creepy

except for that guy and Super Mario

Brothers turns 25 years old today

it's Episode four of IMG today Kotaku

brought us the 10 most bizarre ipad mods

a USB typewriter and ipad arcade and

even an ipad skateboard hot on Digg

right now fantastic post-it note art

they've got wallpaper donkey kong mario

Megaman and a big fu to 2d we've really

got to cover this one last week

duh Mitch calm collected some of jeffrey

Scott Campbell's greatest disney for

adults work enjoy

[Music]

by a BuzzFeed's collection last week

morbidly obese Disney Princesses

I actually found these for the first

time this week artist Larry Kagan

Creed's abstract wire art for walls at

first it just looks like wire spaghetti

bar but when you turn on the lights BAM

the structures are built to cast clean

accurate shadows of common shapes

sometimes they even meld with the

shadows to create one super scary cool

picture but there are definitely

pictures creepier than just shadows

bunnies cats and the most terrifying of

them all what a dick

screw it let's move on to illusions I

first saw this when I was a psychology

student but if you guys haven't seen it

yet it's worth it stare at the center

dot and don't let your eyes move slowly

the circle of pink dots will completely

disappear until you move your eyes and

they pop back into place and here's a

brightness illusion from the annual TED

conference this color is exactly the

same as this color seriously

lay your finger over the crease and

without the depth clues the colors match

are you ready for a doozy put your

finger on the red dot and concentrate go

ahead good good now wait and whoa you

guys are a bunch of bunt touches let's

move on to facebook.com slash vsauce
