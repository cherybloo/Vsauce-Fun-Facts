This is how Easter eggs are made.
And don't walk. Or bike.

It's episode 32 of IMG!

Best haircut... ever.
And creepy t-shirt Abraham Lincoln.

But hunting is awesome.
Oh.

Lishoffs rules. He made the Simpson's alphabet,
a superhero alphabet and curser bullies.

An equally rare talent is found in Jeff Blazer.
He's the guy who photoshopped the famous

Orange Frog. He also made a geographical Pac-Man
and proved that Jim Henson was the puppet.

Europe is naughty. And here's yet another false
motion illusion. Your brain can't figure it

out, so as you look around it warps and stretches.
I suggest going fullscreen.

Chicks love cats. Chicks love cats. Cats
love dogs. Dogs love everything. And cats

love butt gymnastics. You know, like the balance
beam. Balance beer.

This isn't a joke. This is the last thing

Reddit had fun last week with police from
awesome cities like the Flippin police, the

Climax police, and the infamous Sandwich police.

Princess Peach. Grrrrrocery shop yellow, green,
black, red.

Deviant artist Meirou created real-life Disney
princessess. Here's Ariel and Flounder.

Don't look, hey, wait a second.
Let me just turn on the light... line.

But I prefer my lamps soft and gooey and
flowey. And my common objects huge. You might

need gloves this big to touch whatever these
kids are looking at.

Maybe they're watching Facebook.com/Vsaucegaming,
where you guys have submitted 5,428 images

as of the very moment I'm saying this.

Casey showed us extreme kissing, dance mode,
and Marshall dyed an egg in honor of Vsauce.

Trude matured things up with this actual last
name and Carl asked us to cover up the top

half of this equation.

And now it's time to watch LÜT on our other
channel, Vsauce2. It's a different channel

with different types of stuff, so be sure

And as always,

thanks for watching.
