Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. If you threw

every single human alive today into
the Grand Canyon,

we would not fill it up.

We could make a pile about this big

That's it. That's all of us. All 7.159 billion of us

in one place. A species

portrait. It kinda puts humanity into perspective

and you. So does this. Everyday you
produce about one to two litres

of spit, which means, in your entire
lifetime

altogether, you will not produce enough spit

to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool.

So far, 560 billion Lego parts

have been manufactured and the total
number of grains

of sand on Earth is estimated to be 7.5 times 10

to the 18th. But here's the thing:

how many things are there... total?

Well, how do you define a thing?
Well, let's say it's a thing

if you can think about it or talk about it.
If you can call it a thing,

it's a thing.
This is going to be a lot of things.

Things can be real, imaginary,

impossible, ideas are things, things can
be looked forward to and things can be in the past

or yellow or concrete or abstract things can

happen and some thing's probably won't.

Making a video about how many things there are.

That's a thing... that I'm doing right now.

Let's count everything.

Right away, the answer seems obvious. The word

'thing' is so vague, the answer is clearly infinite...

possibly... not.

All we have to do is take the maximum
number of physical things,

things out there in the real
world, beyond our minds we could

in theory measure and add to that the
total number of things we

could imagine. The total number of thoughts possible.

For the purposes of this video let's
assume that numbers and math

and the laws of physics exist as part of the way

our universe is. But the names and
representations they've been given

are the products of thinking minds and those things

are, well, things that we can count.

And there's no reason to double count.
All of the indivisible

pieces that make up me, particles or strings or whatever

are the same as the thing that has been named me.

Abraham Lincoln has a great quote about this.

"How many legs does a sheep have if you call

its tail a leg?"

Four.

Because calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one.

Okay, let's begin. When counting the number of

physical things in the universe we hit an unknown.

How big is the universe?

The entire universe could be infinite

or it could be finite, but edgeless for a
variety of reasons. There could also be

other universes. But it's unclear whether
we'll ever be able to actually see all these

things. Instead, what we are stuck with,
and what we usually mean when we say

'the universe', is the observable universe

whose future visibility limit has been
estimated to be only 62

billion light-years in any direction.

That's it. This is likely the only
inventoryable space we'll ever need

to worry about. And it contains roughly,

on average, ten to the eighty elementary
particles. Particles with no

further internal parts as far as we currently now.

So that's our answer, right? There are ten to the eighty

physical things that exist out there,
beyond our own minds.

Any other physical thing - water, dogs,
planets,

saxophones - are just names given to
particular arrangements of those same

ten to the eighty particles. But wait, what if,

in the future, we discover that what we
call elementary particles today

are actually just made out of smaller
things we should have counted

instead? Well, to cover ourselves let's count

the maximum possible number of the
smallest measurable thing.

Something the size of a Planck volume.

10 to the power of 183

things that small could fit within our observable universe.

I like this number, 10 to the power of 183.

You couldn't easily argue there 
were more things than that

in the physical, real-world.
But you could imagine.

A Planck length, a Planck volume.
That's just

the smallest measurable amount of space,
not the smallest

possible. You could imagine a

half Planck volume, a 10,000th of a Planck volume.

But, that would just be a thought and only ever

a thought. So, how many possible thoughts

are there? It's probably safe to say that
the number of possible

thoughts is, indeed, infinite. For example,

numbers. You can't say there's a limit to
the biggest number we can imagine.

But, unlike physical things that exist
whether or not we have

discovered them, do unthought thoughts

already exist? It seems more like
the pool of possible

thoughts is really just one thing an
actual elements from that set don't

become things by themselves until we thing them

that is we or some other mind thinks
about them

or talks about them and there's a limit to
how many things

we or anything else could ever thing

our observable universe is only so big
and it will contain usable energy

for only so long. After about 1 trillion
to a hundred trillion years

the supply of gas needed to form new
stars will be

exhausted and the lights will start
going out

one-star at a time. After a

Google years the amount of usable energy
left in the universe will be

0 and nothing will be able to happen

to calculate the maximum number up
thoughts that could be

thought inside our observable universe
let's take

all of its mass and turn it into human
brains

that just think new and random thoughts
from the beginning of time

until the universe runs out of usable
energy, a Google years

of thinking. But wait, what if there are

alien brains or for all we know Earthling
brains that

think faster than we can okay well to be
safe

let's not turn all of that mass into
human brains let's use it to build a

giant hypothetical machine that computes at
the fastest speed possible given the

speed of light

in the uncertainty principle; Bremermann's
Limit

its 1.36 times ten to the fifty bits
per second per kilogram

of material, now a high-end estimate for the
total mass of the observable universe

is 3.4 times ten to the the 60 kilograms

which used exclusively for the best
possible computing machine could altogether

process 4.624 times ten to the 110

bits per second. Now with 3.154
times 10 to the 116

seconds available from the beginning of
time to the heat death of the universe

and an assumption that the average
thought takes about a sentance worth

of information to describe

say about 800 bits we get a total

of 1.458 times

ten to the 227 things that could

ever be thought or imagined. That number

is huge. In the observable universe

the universe as we will ever
know it the number of thoughts that can be thought

is so much larger than the number of physical
things there can be with out

imagination and if you were to combine the
two totals

the number of physical things would
barely

make a difference. So, funny enough

when it comes to every thing in the universe

it really is the thought that counts.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
