you

hey Vsauce Michael here do you have a

best friend who is there for you 24/7

365 sorry that's not really good enough

if you're a friend truly had your back

they would be there for you 24 point

zero zero zero zero zero zero six seven

three sixty five point two four two one

eight nine one also George Washington

was born on February 22nd 1732 at least

that's what we're told

however his family Bible says he was

born on February 11th 1730 1/2 so which

is it mister I cannot tell a lie

oh and don't even ask about 1752 in

Russia

17:52 looked pretty normal but check out

what the British Empire was up to that

year nothing really out of the ordinary

except ember the second was followed by

the 14th were eleven days just deleted

where'd they go what happened then it is

time to question time and how the earth

moves reconciling both of these things

has led to some pretty strange things we

all love time-lapse videos of the stars

moving across the sky but really we are

the ones who are

tumbling through the universe on a giant

wet rock vehicle called earth with a

windshield called the sky as viewed from

above the North Pole we spin

counterclockwise west chases east

I always remember this by thinking of

the US as a weird Mane headed animal

with Texas and Florida legs running

forward but we don't just spin

we also revolve around the Sun on a

plane tilted 23.4 degrees relative to

our spin it's kind of nauseating at this

scale but from this perspective you can

see that the Sun rising and setting is

just the earth pointing you towards and

then away from the Sun this motion

causes your sunrise your noon the moment

when the Sun is highest in your sky

before your Sun set to more closely

investigate this movement let's talk

about meridians you are on one at this

very moment your meridian is just

aligned from where you are right now

straight towards the North and South

Poles it's a line of longitude as

opposed to the horizontal lines that lay

flat when north or south is up that we

call flat attune or actually latitude

the Sun is highest in the sky to you

your noon when your Meridian is pointed

right at the Sun a cool thing happens at

this moment all shadows around you point

directly towards one of Earth's poles

unless you're on the sub solar point

the subsolar point is the point on

Earth's surface directly below the Sun

it's always somewhere you can check its

current location online links as always

in the description on the subsolar point

shadows fall straight down so they can

easily disappear twice a year the

subsolar point crosses over Hawaii the

only place in the US where it hits land

and when it does it is called Lahaina

noon meaning cool Sun straight vertical

objects look unnatural during this brief

time like they don't belong as if they

were photoshopped in without regard for

reality in Honolulu a sculpture by Isamu

Noguchi called sky gate casts a twisted

shadow all day every day except during

Lahaina noon when its shadow is a

perfect circle you may not live in a

place where the Sun ever appears

directly overhead but once every Earth

rotation the subsolar point falls

somewhere on your Meridian making it

noon for you the technical name for this

noon for you is local apparent solar

noon the clock on your wrist and the

clock on your phone don't tell you your

local apparent solar time because long

ago we realized that if every meridian

had its own time a person just a few

kilometers away seeing different shadows

than you did would disagree with you on

what time it was so town's adopted their

own time now later on this trick was

standardized and time zones as we know

them today came about but that's not all

we didn't like about shadow based

sundial time to explore deeper we have

to begin by asking what's a day

I mean obviously it's just the time it

takes the earth to turn around once

right but according to what everything

else in space is moving in some way to

the universe doesn't include a

convenient sheet of graph paper at

Absolute rest we can trace paths on the

best we can do on that front is to look

at very very far far far away stars so

far away like distant features of the

landscape out the window of a moving car

they barely move as Earth does now to

them a Meridian on earth completes a

trip around about once every twenty

three point nine hours this is called a

side aerial day side aerial means

pertaining to the Stars even though the

sidereal day seems pretty clear it's not

what our calendars and clocks are based

on because there's a nearer star whose

position relative to us has a bigger

effect on our lives the Sun looking down

on the north pole at Earth's

counterclockwise spin the earth also

moves counterclockwise around the Sun

after a sidereal day the earth has moved

a bit along its orbit so some more

rotation is required for the same

meridian to point back towards the Sun

again this longer definition of one

rotation is what the modern calendar and

clock is based on it is called the solar

day but here's the thing exactly how

long the earth has to rotate to complete

a solar day changes day to day our

clocks are just based on the average

amount of time this takes so throughout

the year they fall ahead and behind the

Sun this is a solar graph a picture of

the sun's path across the sky every

single day if our clocks actually told

us local apparent solar time if you took

a picture of the sky every day at noon

you should get a line of Suns but this

is what really happens

over the course of a year it will appear

as though your clock is running slow and

then fast and then slow again and then

fast again this problem was known since

at least ancient times even if its cause

was it in order to reconcile the two the

equation of time was constructed in this

sense equation means to reconcile the

equation of time was applied to what a

clock said in order to compute the real

time the solar time a sundial would show

now some fancy clocks called equation

clocks were made that would do this for

you but eventually we gave up we gave up

and just said no the real time isn't

what the Sun says it's what our

inventions say now this transition was a

big one it was humanity growing up it

was like the first time you realize

you're stronger than your parents we

realized our timepieces were more

regular and turned our backs on the

timepieces nature had but what causes

this disagreement in the first place

as it turns out the answer revolves

around revolving the way the Earth

revolves around the Sun if the Equator

faced the Sun all the time and the earth

always orbited at the same speed the

subsolar point would just stay right

there on the equator throughout the year

and the amount of extra time spent

rotating the earth needed to do to

finish a solar day would always be the

same but those two things aren't the

case first of all the Earth's orbit is

slightly elliptical so its speed varies

throughout the year when it's moving

around the Sun faster around the

beginning of January the amount of extra

turning time needed to complete the

solar day is longer than when it's

further away from the Sun and moving

more slowly there's more because the

earth is tilted the subsolar point is

dragged throughout the year in a circle

around Earth that's not the equator so

it changes directly

moving northeast then leveling out and

going southeast before leveling out and

going northeast again during times of

the year when the subsolar point is

being dragged by Earth's orbit mostly

east it gains against Earth's spin

faster more time is required for the day

to finish now by coincidence we are

alive at a time when both of these

phenomena lengthen and shorten days at

roughly the same time so they add up

making September 18th almost a minute

shorter than the longest day of the year

December 22nd for northern hemisphere

Ian's December has the shortest periods

of daylight but the whole solar day from

sunrise to sunrise is for everyone on

earth the longest of the year on

December 22nd people in the North just

spent most of it in darkness earth's

tilt it doesn't just affect how long a

day is it also affects how long a year

is this is because the Earth's tilt is

what causes the seasons for the half of

the earth tilted towards the Sun the

same amount of solar radiation is spread

across less space than it is on the

other half so there is more heat energy

laid down per area this causes what we

call summer and winter for the other

half the amount of time from one of

these seasonal orientations of the earth

to its occurrence again is called a

solar year or a tropical year it's a

very useful way to define a year because

it contains every single season exactly

since it's based on the very

orientations that caused them

but the problem is this the number of

solar days that occur in a solar year is

not a whole number

it's almost 365 but after that many

solar days about 1/4 of a day more

happens before the solar year starts

again this makes designing a calendar

more like designing a calendar if your

calendar only ever has 365 days in a

year over time those dates will drift

from the seasonal positions they used to

occur during unless hmm

this extra quarter of a turn adds up to

a full day after four years see March

1st is coming a day too soon now so if

we just delay March by adding an extra

day at the end of February every four

years a leap day we're back on track

leap days do not add days to your life

you're still going to live the same

number of them they just change what we

call them but really who cares about

being one day earlier every four years I

mean one day isn't much you hardly

notice it but over time

well if America's founders had declared

not only independence from Britain but

also from leap days and abolished them

from happening today 240 years later

their calendar would be a full two

months ahead of Earth's position putting

America's coldest winter days in April

and its hottest summer days in October

adding a day every four years is what

the famous Julian calendar does

introduced in 46 BC by Julius Caesar

it was the defacto standardized Western

calendar for a very long time more than

a millennium but it's not perfect

look closely

leap days actually move the calendar

just slightly too far each time because

I lied 365 and a quarter solar days

don't occur within one solar year the

real number is slightly less and

fluctuates year-to-year based on

long-term changes to earth and the sun's

movements which means adding one day

every four years is just a teensy weensy

too many by 1582 julian calendar dates

were ten days behind the seasons

compared to where they used to be that's

not bad

ten days and more than a millennium and

a half but the Catholic Church cared

because they wanted Easter to occur

exactly when it used to centuries ago

astronomers at the time realized that if

leap days pushed the calendar too far

behind the seasons we would just need to

celebrate fewer of them to fix the

problem specifically we would need three

fewer leap days every four centuries the

rule they wrote to achieve this stated

that every four years would continue to

be a leap year except if it was

divisible by 100 unless it was also

evenly divisible by 400 this removes

three every 400 years on October 4th

Pope Gregory the 13th introduced this

new calendar it took his name the

Gregorian calendar

he also undid the drift that had

occurred since the early days of the

Julian and declared on October 4th that

tomorrow would be October 15th

October 5th to the 14th never happened

in 1582 in countries that listened to

the Pope it took the rest of the world

centuries to hop on board England and

its colonies like the soon-to-be United

States of America adopted the Gregorian

in September of 1750 - by which point

their Julian dates were off from the

seasons by 11 days hence the

disappearing of the 3rd through 13th

when adopted the 1st of the year was

also moved from March to January first

this explains why George Washington's

birthday has two answers although more

closely hitched to the seasons than the

Julian the Gregorian calendar still

isn't perfect its difference causes

dates to become one day off from the

seasons every 3,000 216 years other

calendars have been proposed like the

one stand-up maths calculated that

drifts off even more slowly his video is

a great watch by the way but enough of

all of this let's sit back and enjoy

Earth's movement without trying to

divide it up and name it as a caveat

keep in mind that Earth's oceans and

liquid insides and other celestial

bodies are always pulling and tugging

and sloshing around minutely changing

Earth's movements their effect is

measurable but difficult to notice at

big scales and also don't look like much

in the short term short like the length

of a human life looking from above the

North Pole the equator spin

counterclockwise at about sixteen

seventy kilometers per hour relative to

the Sun Earth orbits counterclockwise at

one hundred and eight thousand

kilometers per hour along a path tilted

23.4 degrees to it's spin within our

local neighborhood of stars our entire

solar system is drifting seventy

thousand kilometers per hour roughly in

the direction of the bright star Vega in

the constellation of Lyra and our solar

system is part of a giant galaxy called

the Milky Way on a plane tilted about

sixty degrees approximately like the

windshield of a car looking from above

Earth's North Pole our entire solar

system races clockwise around the

galactic center at about seven hundred

and ninety two thousand km/h our whole

galaxy is also moving through the

universe we know this because when the

universe was very young it was so hot

electrons and protons jumped around and

photons of light scattered constantly

they couldn't travel very far before

scattering again so the universe was

opaque

but then around 380,000 years after the

Big Bang the universe cooled just enough

for electrons and protons to form

hydrogen suddenly abruptly photons

decoupled from this obstacle course and

could travel relatively unencumbered the

universe became transparent to light

since that moment those early photons

have been propagating through space

every day

ancient photons that last scattered off

this opaque fog at the moment of

decoupling a light date further from

Earth currently is reach us they are

part of the cosmic microwave background

radiation it is visible in every

direction microwave because although

they used to be more energetic the

universe's expansion has redshifted them

now some parts of this radiation are

more redshifted than others because of

our own movement through the universe

controlling for the movements we've

already talked about relative to this

infinite cooling baby picture of the

universe the first and oldest detectable

light we are headed riding along in the

Milky Way in the direction that the

constellations of Leo and Virgo are to

us at a speed of 2.1 million kilometers

per hour towards a thing we don't fully

understand yet simply called the Great

Attractor this is how you on Earth's

surface are moving through the

universe aboard Spaceship Earth okay now

stop this is roughly 100 years of

Earth's movement through space this path

we trace for where we began here is the

path you will take through the universe

in your lifetime you didn't buy a ticket

for this ride your parents signed you up

without asking but nonetheless it is

quite literally the ride of your life
