Vsauce hello Michael here and an IMG 12

I showed you some Kinect fails but today

I want to explore my favorite Kinect

wins the Kinect tracks 20 joints on your

body 30 times a second and with simple

drivers people from all over the world

are taking it into their own hands

besides exploiting the fact that it's an

actual 3d camera people are harnessing

it to play all sorts of games with their

hands in the air like they just don't

care for example Minecraft Mario Kart

Super Mario Brothers or this guy who

made a demo of 3d Tetris where your

hands manipulate the pieces and you can

move your head to change the screens

perspective a few days ago Kevin showed

you a guy who used the Kinect emotion

track his nipples and cover them up well

if you're less shy do what this guy did

program your Kinect to recognize and

reify your air guitar it's like playing

rock band but without all the plastic

paraphernalia this guy let it detect his

body but then replace it with the back

wall to make him the Invisible Man

creepy right well not as creepy as this

here's someone who took the connects

recognition of his body and had it

transformed him in real time to a giant

pillowy blob mutant in case you're

curious yes he did make a follow-up

video with his cat but why not mount the

Kinect on a robot and use it as the

robots eyes well these people did and

since the Kinect sees in 3d of course

it's a flying robot question what if the

Star Wars kid was not only a dork but

also a geek

answer he may have done what this guy

did use the Kinect to track a wooden

stick and give it a lightsaber overlay

or if you prefer Christmas lights check

out this girl who can control lights

like a conductor by waving her hands to

see more of these and other kinect hacks

or to get pointers on how to experiment

yourself check out kinect hacks net or

follow the links in this video's

description where links to everything I

covered can be found oh oh and and let

me know in the comments below what year

you think it will be when our brains are

completely replaced by computers 2070

3015 or are you one of those crazy

people on the street who think it

already happened well either way I want

to know

leave it in the comments and as always

thanks for watching
