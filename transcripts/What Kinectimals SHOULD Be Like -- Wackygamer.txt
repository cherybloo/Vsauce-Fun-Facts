um you turned me on to this I missed I

missed this game what is this game uh

Kinectimals kinectimals for those of you

who didn't see the trailer you can go

check it out it is a game we have a

virtual pet and there there been these

games before yeah that called um not

that you could stroke and pet and feel

we are young - off he could be like

what is it called

but 'no tell well it's now the kinect

and the kinectimals the kinect use the

Kinect to rub your TV screen and then a

 baby Tigers gonna fall in love

with you this looks like the worst

 thing I have a three-year-old

niece I know for a fact she wouldn't

want to play this game

she's be dissipated us no ID on the tops

of his playlist this game looks so dumb

here's okay here's the thing if they're

going to have a game like this where you

can you have your own virtual pet this

is a time where you should be able to

beat your virtual pet you should be able

to beat the out of that and now

we're going back to the fable 3 thing

Nona smack oh yeah I want to be able to

beat up endangered species I want to be

able to pick out terrible snow snow

tiger kittens that's what I want to beat

up so Tiger because the one in the

trailer is just a regular time just

regular tiger I want you wanted not

again it's not exotic enough for right

who hasn't beaten a tiger so would you

want to like rape an aardvark - this

starting to sound at least mildly

interesting like it's it's it's

all the responsibility and boredom of

having a pet on your TV it's I don't get

it I don't you don't have to like feed

it er yeah whatever

what do I okay I also don't get to touch

it now you can touch it no not in real

life it's not like I feel any textures

and then the games I get to play with it

I saw one of the games really

interesting game called balancing let's

get on a balance here I got I got news

for you I got news for you whoever are

the jackasses made this game

Tigers have perfect balance they

don't need help they don't need a sista

true from like a four-year-old you know

little girl in her living room number

one number two what kind of

family was that in that commercial it

was a weird family because it's it's

like a white woman

well they're black hid in a Chinese kid

here's the fucked-up part about all the

Microsoft commercials they're in the

same living room they are always in the

same which is like is this one house

like 16 is this a boarding house that

were filming the in I was I was

watching I think that no this does

happen with every you're right it

every with everyone because I always

watch and I tried figure out like who

are these people's relationships like

you know who are these people how do

they know each other you know cuz it's

never like I can identify one or the

other and be like you know uh that's the

father that's the mother you can't

figure that out it's horrible the

best part is at the dance central promo

trailer not the one that we watch with

the gameplay footage but the the one

where it shows the family dancing oh my

god have you seen this see this is

exactly why than one and there's a

blonde mom mm-hmm mom's got a

badonkadonk and she's just rub it all

over the kids faces as she's dancing

which is the best thing but hey

oh love it kids emotionally scarring a

money sort of meds that's Microsoft's

new thing it's like hey let's ruin child

well the way they had a frame they

didn't show the kids sitting at the

dining room table whacking it well no

they just shot the kid who's getting ass

hit into his face crying

Oh

you
