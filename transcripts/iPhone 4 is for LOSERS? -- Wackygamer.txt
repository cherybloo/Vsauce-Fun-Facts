today was Thursday we're recording this

Thursday Ju Thursday exciting part I

phone for launch that's not exciting

I went 7:00 a.m. this morning you're

pathetic to the Apple store no not what

the the point in getting I five

phone for what's-what's what's different

with the retinal display what's

different than iPhone three what's the

difference between iPhone 4s bleh it's

awesome

no no that's not a difference okay you

will actually wanna know the difference

so I had two 3G mm-hmm and since then

there's been a 3GS but the display is a

lot better you can read the text way

easier

oh because that's been such a problem

Jeff I remember you've been calling me

up in the middle of night well you know

like Adam I'm calling you on my iPhone

but I wish I knew I was called new cuz I

can't even read this no way MIT that

never happened no it was fine it

is fine did it reason I bought the new

one mmm-hmm the video camera the video

the iPhone 3 didn't have a video camera

3G did not have a video camera it had a

static camera but no video no video so

that's one improvement

yeah and for comedy you know it's

sometimes helpful all right I guess I

can see that um otherwise I would have

stuck with my old one but honestly I'll

say this an entire city block full of

people all needing a phone that also

takes video Nomos those people are just

getting backed off - yeah it's home I

don't I don't get it I don't get it it's

like for me if somebody's gonna put out

something new a new version of something

it better be incredibly

different than it was incredibly

different no it has it has a can

it's got a metal edge the metal edge see

all this you know it's it's

just it's it's that no display you know

what it reminds me and a back facing

camera you know what it reminds me of GI

Joe I took GI Joe or Ninja Turtles the

fact that every every couple months

they'd come out with a new GI Joe or a

new ninja turtle that didn't look really

anything different than one of the other

ones except it was like one of the GI

Joes painted somewhat differently or one

of the GI Joe or one of the Ninja

Turtles it's like oh well instead of a

turtle these are ninja frogs they're

Samurai Ferrar it's kind of like

transformers and gobots

yes it's garbage

instead of costing $5.95 they have to

beg your mom for $200 200 dollars

how much did your camera cost we're

using a camera right here how much did

that cost a grand a grand that is a nice

camera that ruined that ruined my whole

grand scheme he was trying to pull but

still still point is I don't think the

new iPhone is worth it it's totally

worth it Adams dumb I don't I don't

think it's worth it man

and this is why items a bad nerd no

horrible nerd no yeah you like it I'm a

nerd I'm a horrible nerd because I have

the ability to understand the gimmicks

that people are pulling on it's a game

as an awesome device it's it has a

camera that's the only difference

difference but if you hadn't bought a

phone why not get knife on well okay

okay you're right if I had to buy phone

did you so you didn't have a phone you

only had your landline before the iPhone

came out yeah dude

no you had an all I had was a telegraph

machine he had an eye which wasn't

really inconvenient he had an iPhone

this morning when he went to the Apple

store to buy a new iPhone and you know

what the Apple employees are crying for

me whatever whatever it's just sad I

might as well gone in cowboy gear I'm

gonna come out I'm coming out with a new

product mariya America it's called the

rock I even say America it's a rock and

next in next year I'm coming out with a

brand new one it's called rock 2.0 and

it's shiny yeah there you go spend $500

on me it's gotta have multitasking and

folders you know that was just an OS

upgrade but you know whatever whatever

whatever Steven note OS is it's kind of

funny I don't care
