This cat better watch out. And the only
thing more badass than guns

It's episode 33 of IMG!

This is every way

Mario can die on one page.
And this is a Hadouken manicure.

Could you grab me some peanut butter?
Oh, but watch out for the honey.

Shaving cream.

But the best type of spill? Cat face.

Look how happy it made this guy.
What? Ohhhh.

Banana dog. Better than a heart butt.
And spot the difference.

Here's Lady Gaga drinking tea. Some guys
really, really like this and thus

Enjoy.

Remember the Big Bad Wolf?
Well, here's what he should

have done. Do you guys accept Batman & Joker

did it. But now let's lay down with stuffed
animal versions of ourselves and enjoy

Uh, just kidding.
Going for the dunk?

Wait, wait, wait. You got a booger there.
And you know what? Lots of guys get caught staring.

John Kerry, even Obama.
Sometimes it's sneaky,

sometimes it's surprising and sometimes
it's just judgmental.

On Facebook.com/VsauceGaming Anton
showed me that Sponge Bob

is made out of sadness.
Stephanie introduced a keyboard shaped

waffle maker and Krishna showed as a dog
that can make things float
