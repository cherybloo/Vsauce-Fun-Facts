Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

When will you die? I don't mean you

specifically, I mean the mean of you all - the average

Vsauce viewer. By combining World
Health Organization life tables with YouTube

analytics for Vsauce viewers, we can calculate

that the average date everyone over the age of 15

watching this video right now will die on is

8:42 in the morning, November 28th, 2059.

The mode is in 2073.

Morbidly, but mathematically, about 340

of the people who watch this video this
week will not be around at this time

next year. These statistics are based on
averages but interestingly

the average person considers him or
herself anything

but average. Studies have consistently shown that the

average person believes he or she will
live a longer and healthier life

than the average person. We overestimate

the likelihood that bad things will
happen to other people and underestimate

the likelihood that they will happen to
us. It's a natural part of our psychology,

but, yeah, we miscalculate risk in many fascinating

ways. K.C. Cole points out that we are
often more responsive to threats that are personal

exotic, erratic and dramatic

than we are to threats that are well more likely.

I love one of her examples - imagine a
world where cigarettes

are harmless, but one cigarette pack

out of every eighteen thousand seven
hundred and fifty contains

a single cigarette laced with dynamite
that, when lit,

violently explodes, blowing the user's head off.

People would be loudly

and messily losing their heads every
day all over the world

but in that imaginary universe the same
number of people would die every day

because of smoking

that already do. The results

would just be more shocking, more
immediate and probably more likely to

affect our decisions.

Last month, I and some of my favourite
YouTube creators met

with President Obama about the decisions

Americans make when it comes to
protecting themselves from the cost

of staying healthy. The issue with health
care is mired in conflict and debate

matched only by the turmoil of risk
assessment going on

in our own minds.

Our myelinated machines use more biases and
shortcuts to evaluate probabilities

than can fit in a single video, but a
particularly strong example

is the availability heuristic. Our
tendency to think that something is more likely

because it happened recently or there
are more examples of it happening

available in our memories, not because it
actually is more likely.

We also over exaggerate risks we don't
have control over

while being comparatively fearless in
the face of equal

risks we nonetheless can control. Chianti
Stars famous 1969 study on risk

found that people were willing to accept risks
1,000 times greater

if they could control them, for instance,
driving a car than if they

didn't have control, for instance, a
nuclear disaster.

Let's talk about Abraham Wald.

Only so much extra armour can be added to
an airplane before it becomes too heavy to fly.

Now, during World War 2 the US military
noticed the planes returning

from enemy territory were usually damage
around the wings,

the body and the tail gunners.
So, they put more armour

on those areas. But it didn't make a
difference. The same number of planes

continued to be lost. So the military hired Wald

for his mathematical super powers.
He told them to put what little

armour they could on the parts of the planes that

weren't being hit. Why?

Well, because returning planes were survivors.

They took damage in areas where a plane
can take damage

and survive. Damage to other areas
caused the plane to

not return.
Wald was protecting them against

survivorship bias - only paying attention

to successes. A similar phenomenon is
partly responsible for why music

feels like it was just better back in
the day than it is now.

Is that really true or are we just remembering

the good stuff? Wald's work saved
thousands of lives and made flying safer

for many more. Tragically, a few years
later Wald and his wife

died in an airplane crash. You can't

predict how and when you will die, it's not that easy.

But a few risk scoring systems have been created

to make the discussion and comparison of
hazardous behaviors

clearer. The micromort was conceived by

Ronald A. Howard and is an amount of risk
equal to a one in 1,000,000 probability

of dying. John Green discussed Micromorts

in a fantastic mental floss video you
should watch, if you haven't already.

He points out that a single skydive
temporarily increases your

death risk by seven micromorts - a seven

in 1,000,000 chance of dying. That's the same

as smoking 5 cigarettes. It's been
estimated that you gain one micromort

for every half litre of wine you drink.

Every year you spend drinking Miami tap water, every 1,000 miles you fly in a jet plane,

every 230 miles you travel by car, every
20 miles you travel by bicycle

and every 6 miles you travel by motorcycle

or canoe. There is a happier

unit of risk - the microlife. Proposed by
David Spiegelhalter and Alejandro Leiva,

a microlife is gained by doing helpful

things. In small quantities their benefits are roughly

linear and one microlife is the equivalent of

30 extra minutes of life.
Twenty minutes of moderate exercise

gives you two more microlives.

Two hours of sedentary behavior

-1 microlives. Plenty of

non-scientific websites exist that allow
you to calculate when you will die

based on your life expectancy and habits.

PokeMyBirthday.com is the kind of goofy site

that takes a nonetheless interesting look
at not your death,

but your birth. Enter your birthday and
see when you were conceived,

when your mother probably first realized
she was pregnant with you

and the dates your parents created or
moved into position the two cells

that eventually became the thirty trillion cells

that are now watching this video. Every single person

who ever died, died right here on planet Earth.

Except for three.

The crew of Soyuz 11.

On June 30th, 1979, their cabin depressurized,

while returning to Earth, before they
crossed the agreed-upon boundary between

Earth and outer space. Far from

any populated area, a three-sided metallic columns

sits where they're craft landed in Kazakhstan.

It's a remote memorial to humankind's

remotest deaths. We haven't

all died here on Earth, but so far we have all been born

here. Thanks for being here.

Stay safe, and as always,

 thanks for watching.
