Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

And this strawberry weights about 50 grams, which
according to Russell Seitz also happens to

be the weight of the entire Internet.
What does that mean?

I mean, the Internet is a gigantic place and
how do you measure information?

Well, let's start a little bit smaller with
a Kindle.

Right now, I'm reading Gadsby, which is a
great novel that makes complete sense, except

it was written without ever using the letter
"e," which is awesome.

But when I put Gadsby on my Kindle, did my
Kindle gain weight?

Well, theoretically, yes it did.
Information is stored on flash drives like

this and on my Kindle in binary.
And that binary physically exists because

electrons charge floating gate transistors.
And the thing about electrons is that they

have mass.
In fact, a professor at Berkeley estimated

that when a Kindle is completely full of books,
its weight increases by about 10 to the negative

18th grams.
That number is mind blowingly miniscule.

In fact, he says that when you fully charge
a Kindle's battery, it gains 100 million times

more mass than it does when you fill it with
books.

But even then the number is impossible to
measure.

The most specific scales we've ever created
only measure to about 10 to the negative 9th

grams.
So let's get bigger.

Russell Seitz came up with his measurement
because the Internet is composed of networks

of servers and they're about 75 to 100 million
servers operating to make the Internet work.

Combined, that many servers equal about 40
billion Watts of electricity and we know that

an Amp is about 10 to the 18th electrons per
second.

And since we know the weight of an electron
we can calculate that the entire Internet

is really just about 50 grams of electrons
in motion.

Now that number only includes servers.
And Seitz says that if you wanna include the

chips in personal computers as well, the number's
about 3 times larger.

But there's a weight of the Internet that
impresses me a little bit more.

It's a calculation not of the energy it takes
to serve the Internet, but the energy contained

in the actual information.
The videos, the pictures, the e-mails.

How much do they all collectively weigh when
stored?

Well, here's the thing.
It takes about 8 billion electrons to store

one e-mail.
8 billion sounds like a lot, but electrons

are tiny and so one e-mail only weighs about
two ten-thousandths of a quadrillionth of

an ounce.
But the Internet contains lots of e-mails

and it contains lots of video and images and
celebrity rumours, so how much does it weigh

altogether?
Well, the first question we have to ask is

how big is the Internet and that's difficult
to calculate, but Eric Schmidt, then-CEO of

Google, once estimated that the entire Internet
contains about 5 million Terabytes of information,

of which, he said, Google has only indexed
0.004%.

Okay, so not counting the energy it takes
to deliver the Internet, the information itself

on the Internet is about 5 million Terabytes.
Now, we know how many electrons it takes to

form a single byte and we know the mass of
an electron and so with a little bit of math

you can figure out that the entire Internet,
everything on it, collectively only weighs

0.2 millionths of an ounce.
Think of it this way: every single video on

YouTube, every single video across the entire
web, every single image, every single website,

every e-mail you've sent, every love
letter you've written, every photo of your

grandkids you've received is collectively
held within an amount of mass about the size

of the smallest possible grain of sand.
If you follow @tweetsauce on Twitter you can

learn even more.
I'm gonna share some more facts there that I didn't

include in this video around electricity in
general.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
