want some extra B sauce on your wtfs

well you're in luck Ready set go wait

toad what are you doing I oh clever

taking advantage of a game's glitch to

shorten your lap time is one thing but

patience is another see that guy over

there let's shoot some arrows way up

into the air yeah okay good now let's go

talk to him have a nice casual chat time

goes by nothing suspicious is happening

ooh except you know what what goes up

must come down but really why be so

crafty when you can just force it like

getting your puppy to eat eat it Duke

Nukem always had great dancers but by

adding in the high res pack I can feel

even

more um lonely in the real world walls

of death and mhing look like this but in

Assassin's Creed it happens like

[Music]

this or if Romance is more your style

there's always

[Music]

crisis you can also make the dancing

happen Yourself by physically lifting a

game cartridge interrupting the flow of

data when you do that things like this

occur but don't worry you can always

Escape in your

plane or use more sophisticated tools

and calculate the most advantageous

position and action for a character at

every moment tool assisted runs like the

these in many cases are the fastest way

you can beat a game without using a

cheat that's why it looks like Jesus

picked up a controller prefer horror

sometimes when the Sims crashes kids

grow up but they keep their infant

bodies the result is a terrifying

stretched out baby who turns into a

black creeper when it goes indoors but

as we all know the only thing scarier

than Sims mutants is land sharks or is

it let me know in the comments below

what you think the scariest animal

grizzly bears on Horseback cats on crack

I don't know you tell me and if you

haven't done this already click here to

play Rusty's interactive game are you

nerd enough Fallout New Vegas you think

you have what it takes well check it out

it's awesome and let me know how you did

and as always thanks for watching
