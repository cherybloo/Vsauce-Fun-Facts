hey Vsauce Michael here and I've got

some good news today I'm bringing you a

bunch of Vsauce WTF s and hey those

always make people happy first a replay

from Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 the

goalie stops the ball and as we move

forward frame by frame but head at least

he knew to catch the ball not go under

it no no no no guys stay above ground

gosh dang it the only thing worse is

when friction just gives up now how is

it that this man defies physics easy

it's the shades check out my virtual

girlfriend I'm not sure how long it's

gonna stay in the App Store but you can

get it right now and the game allows you

to design a girlfriend take her on dates

and if you play your cards right see her

put on lingerie and even touch her or at

least the screen this downloadable map

is sweet the textures on the wall are

Minecraft but you're actually playing

left 4 dead we've seen Rube Goldberg

machines before but this digital one

created using Garry's Mod is epic

almost as epic as this character

animation sorry well no need to get

violent I just and yes those numbers are

real this video linked in the

description contains 101 different ways

he can die don't you hate it when cute

pictures go like this these sauces

covered crazy dancing before but this

guy seems possessed oh wait no he's fine

and doesn't it suck when someone can

crash faster than you can drive you

might as well play Mario Kart we crash

into a mountain and then drive up it

impossibly here's a cat plane

kinectimals with the Xbox Kinect and

here's somebody's dad dancing to Britney

Spears

in Dragon Age Origins the game doesn't

always understand beheading your victims

can still talk to you and get sassy

Donkey Kong 64 in game shark are great

together you can make RAM be the Rhino

fly or walk on his face the big deal

Mario can do that too that's it for this

episode of Vsauce WTF s but there's

plenty more

and you can click any of these to watch

other episodes and then click the little

button the lower left of those videos to

come back to this menu before you go

watch them let me know in the comments

below what game are you playing the most

right now for me honestly it's dragging

the huge origins look have fun and as

always thanks for watching
