This cow has an illusion face.
See the people about to kiss?

And oh my gosh, what's this?
Nice.

It's episode 44 of IMG!

If you eat too many Pringles you'll feel like

this.
And if you look like this, your kids will

too.
Now, if you look at this right in the middle

and move your head towards and away, the stars
will appear to rotate.

And speaking of rings of things, these are
4 perfectly round circles.

Give yourself a new face in the sand or, if
you're lucky, find a sweeter face in some

ice cream.
Now if this one dot represents all the fire

power used by all sides during World War II,
one Poseidon submarine contains the raw explosive

fire power of 3 world wars.
Oh and the rest of these dots?

They represent the total fire power of all
man made nuclear weapons currently on Earth.

Vertical comic time.
Okay, alright, cool.

Zoom in.
Yep, that's what I thought.

Now, let's be serious.
Animated GIFs.

Of course, when the format was first created
its developers pronounced it "jif," which

It causes your brain waves and your heart

rate to synchronise.
According to the researchers, the next most

relaxing songs ever made in order are these.
And now a company that makes custom-stuffed

animals based on your children's drawings.
Enjoy.

Ah, come on, cheer up.
Here's a cleaning cart with a big grin.

Which these girls don't have.
I mean, come on, he'd rather touch a koala

butt.
Let's get infographic-y.

This interactive site shows when Mosaic started,
what all of its versions looked like and moves

through Netscape to Opera, IE, and beyond.
And this flowchart lets you choose the perfect

book off of NPR's list of the top 100 sci-fi
and fantasy books.

Finally, here's a great infographic about
our solar system that shows distances from

the Sun to scale.
We've got the Earth, Saturn, all the way out

to dwarf planet Pluto and beyond.
Hey Vsauce! Michael Here!
