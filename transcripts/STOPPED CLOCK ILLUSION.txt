Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today I've got a brand new episode

of Vsauce Leanback.
You can click this annotation

or the link at the top of the
description to start it and then you can

just lean back

and the autoplay playlist bring the
knowledge right to your brain.

As you already know, it doesn't really
work on mobile phones yet so wait until

you are in a better position to lean back.

In the meantime, let's get saccadic.

No, not psychotic, saccadic,

referring to what is known as
a saccade, the quick

movements that our eyeballs make
when we move from one

object to the other. As you may remember
from a previous Leanback, some animals,

like most birds,

cannot move their eyeballs. And so to look
from one thing to another they have to

move their head really really fast

and to keep the world from being blurry
when their bodies move, they have to keep

their heads completely stationary.

But here's the neat thing about saccades.
When our eyes move,

there's a quick blur between

one destination and the other. And that
blur is completely incomprehensible to

our brain.

So what are visual system does is erase it

from our memory and instead replace that
little fraction of a second that our eye

moved during

with the very next thing we see.
This leads to a really amazing illusion

called

'The Stopped Clock Illusion."
You may have noticed this before

if you've ever been in a room with a
clock with a second hand, like in a

classroom,

darting your eyes back and forth
waiting for class

to be out. Now here is what happens.
Right when you dart your eyes to the clock,

that very first second, that very first
movement of the second hand

that happens when your eyes reach it
seems longer

than every other second afterwards.
Look away from the clock

and then look.
And that first second will seem to linger,

as if time itself has stopped.
The reason for that

is that your brain replaces the time
it took for your eye to go from here

to the clock with an image of the
first thing you saw, which was the second-hand.

And so, that little fraction of a
second of time is added

to length of time it takes the second-hand to
move. What's really mind-blowing about

this entire

effect is that it happens all the time.
All day,

as you look around the world from one
point to another, that little fraction of

a second

that your eyeball was moving is lost
and your brain just replaces it with the very

next thing

that you see. Now, it might just be
a tiny tiny amount of time,

but over the course of an entire day
those little fraction of a second

add up to almost 40 minutes.

40 minutes of everyday that you're awake
are lost

because our eyeballs move.

And as always,

thanks for watching.

So what are you waiting for,

You know what? I totally

never say this... Yeah, I'm totally heterosexual, but..
You are really attractive!
