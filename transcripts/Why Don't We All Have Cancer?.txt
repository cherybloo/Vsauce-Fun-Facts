Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

Since this video began

more than a million of your cells have

died. It's natural, don't worry.

But you are literally covered with death

Dead stuff. Fingernails, your hair,

the outermost layer of your skin - all
made out of dead things.

And you are losing this dead stuff
constantly. Every week

about 5.5 grams of dead skin sheds off of your body.

Ohio State University found that 80%

of that material you see indoors,
beautifully dancing across sunbeams,

is dead human skin.

But for the most part, you are made out of

living stuff. You are a biological

furnace, burning food energy to move and breathe and

think and stay warm. As you can see on
Grand-Illusions[.com], the heat from your own

hand while you sit still

is enough to run a Stirling engine.

Your cells are busy and active and dividing

millions and millions of times every day.
In fact, because of that, you shouldn't even

really be called a person.

You should be called a persON

and on and on and on and on and on and
on and on... But here's the really

mind-blowing

thing about the mind sustaining process of cell division,

the replication of instructions.
DNA for each daughter cell

requires copying an exact sequence

of three billion nucleotides. That's a lot.

Luckily, our bodies are perfect-ly happy
to do it but they're not perfect.

Every time a single cell in your body
divides, the enzymes that synthesize

your DNA

make 120,000 mistakes.

Some of these mistakes

wind up being beneficial. Some of these
mistakes wind up being harmful and

some are just neutral,

they don't make a difference.
But if a mistake,

a mutation in a cell's DNA, causes the
cell to behave abnormally

and stimulate its own growth, ignore signals to stop,

stimulate the body to give it its own
blood supply, potentially

multiply forever and unstick from
where it began to spread throughout the body,

it becomes a special type of cell.

We have found 200 diseases with various
origins and natures that

fit this description. Despite being
different, they often go by the same name:

cancer.

DNA mutations occur randomly in your body

but they can also be inherited or caused
by the environment.

For example, exposure to ultraviolet
radiation from the Sun

can cause all kinds of damage,
including genetic damage.

If little or no skin protection is
used, the accumulation of all these types of damage

can be quite dramatic. This man drove a truck

for years, exposing one side of his face to more sunlight

than the other.

And for 15 years this woman worked in a room

that had the same window. A window to her left.

Environmental damage to the body,

whether cancer-causing or not, is serious business.

In fact, giraffes have black tongues
because the dark pigmentation protects

their tongues

from solar radiation while they're hanging out all day.

Go back far enough, beyond where sunshine
hits, and their tongues are pink.

Given the sheer number of environmental
dangers to our DNA

and the sheer number of mistakes our own
bodies make with our DNA every day,

it is incredible that we all aren't
developing cancers constantly

and immediately after being born.
One of the things we have to thank

is our body's own version of autocorrect.

Biological mechanisms, like proofreading
and mismatch repair,

catch and correct or stop more than 99% of errors.

We grow old and pass away for many,

many reasons.
But when it comes to cancers, our bodies'

own internal autocorrect is like the autocorrect

on your phone. It's pretty good, but it's
not perfect. Cancers

still develop, especially after the
accumulation of mistakes and mutations

over time. I'm incredibly grateful to
Cancer Research UK.

They helped me a lot with this
episode, and thanks to work by groups like them,

we are at an accelerating rate finding
ways to prevent and control cancer

beyond what our bodies can do alone.
I mean, after all, natural selection can

only see so much

because of the selection shadow.

We aren't all the same and if your genetic
variations make you and your children

more successful at reproducing,

well, what do you know, your
characteristics become more common.

But this phenomenon has a weak influence

here. Later in life, after your role in
reproduction and raising offspring to

independence

has passed.

We have found evidence of the selection shadow

at work with mice and bats.

Raised under perfect conditions, with
veterinary medicine and safe lives,

mice only live about two to three years.

Whereas bats, with similar sizes and
metabolisms, can live for

thirty years or more. The significant
difference here is that

unlike mice, bats have had in the wild
for millions of years

fewer predators - a smaller chance of dying early

due to extrinsic mortality. They've, on
average, had more days for natural selection

to influence. This could be a very good
explanation for why diseases that affect

our complex multicellular selves

late in life are still with us.

But wait, why are humans living so long today?

I mean, in the past, but genetically recently, weren't

teenagers considered middle aged?

Not really. Well, it's true that in the
past life expectancies were quite

a bit lower, a life expectancy is merely an

average number of years a person was
expected to live as soon as they were born.

And in the past, infant mortality was so high

the average was brought down
significantly. It's true that in the

early 1600s, here

in England, life expectancy was only 35 years.

But if you made the age of 21... Well,

you could easily expect to live well into your 60s.

Lifespans that go beyond the age of reproduction have

always made sense for humans,
because we are intelligent

and social, useful to one another and our children

take a lot of time and guidance to gain independence.

But that just moves the selection shadow ahead. 
It's still there,

suggesting that, in the end, our bodies might just be

tools our sex cells use to reproduce

and grow up to do it again. Nature and
time haven't helped our bodies battle

late acting diseases because a chicken

is just an egg's way of making another egg.

But maybe not for long. Our minds and
modern science technology engineering

and mathematics are making progress

against late acting diseases.
And when it comes to cancers,

Cancer Research UK points out that 40 years ago

only one in four people lived ten years or longer

after being diagnosed.
Today that number is 2 in 4.

And they believe that in only twenty years
that statistic could be as high as 3 in 4.

Refrigeration and sanitation are
tackling stomach cancers caused by infection,

vaccines are preventing cervical cancer,
anti-smoking campaigns and reductions

of obesity and diabetes and the elimination

of cancer-causing chemicals from our
everyday lives are giving us an edge.

We learn more every single day. The process

is slow, but steady. Because cancer is not just

one thing. It's unlikely there will ever
be a single cure for cancer because

there are two hundred different types

of cancers. But there will be cures and
better methods of prevention

and detection.
Advances are coming from all over.

For example, what we have learned about
controlling proton beams because of the

Large Hadron Collider

has reduced the need for special shields
during the removal of eye tumours.

The statistical surprise that cancers
aren't more common in our bodies

is a sign that we're involved in a relay race.

Natural selection already did some of the
work, now it's our turn.

When we talk about cancer
we often use the language of war:

it's a battle, it's a fight.
But the challenge

isn't so much a war with winners and
losers and surrender

as it is a mutiny.
We can't help the fact that we are all at sea.

Natural selection at least gave us boats

but now we are making where those boats go

our decision.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
