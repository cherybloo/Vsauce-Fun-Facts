hey everybody Jeff from Waikiki gamer

the new BioShock Infinite trailer came

out commentaries afterwards

[Music]

play

[Music]

what's BioShock Infinite it's this game

that's set in the Bioshock unit no it's

not yes it is all right

I'm really really excited about this

game I guarantee you of rationals gonna

knock it out of the park but the trailer

has me wondering what the heck's going

on it's in a space well it's a guy this

guy

it's a sky city if I wanted that I'd go

play Star Wars and play investment how

can you even call it Bioshock Bioshock

is very specific about the plasmon world

underwater big daddy's little sisters

you think what do you think when you

think Bioshock well I do think

underwater but it's just one city in the

whole world why does every city have to

be underwater in Bioshock you can't just

put a sky city and call it Bioshock the

I you know what I liked Bioshock up

until I got to the Big Daddies and then

I hated it so you hated the whole game

yeah basically you're an idiot

Bioshock was one of the best games ever

second was good I don't think it was

good as person one story wasn't as good

I've only played the first one and I

used all my ammo on that big daddy and

he just killed me over and over to shows

I don't know if you've seen our Marvel

vs. Capcom video where I kicked his ass

just shows how bad he is a game I mean I

thank you so much Jeff just meet you

more a day the worst part about this

trailer beyond the name and the fact

that they're calling a Bioshock is

there's not a lick a gameplay well and

there's barely a story there's a guy

falling who got fallen and a woman

catches him if you could call for script

catching I thought the force grip is

neat I don't know why she needed roses

yeah woman absorb all the roses she's

kind of like oh I just kind of need to

see what I'm gripping help me make a

bouquet I'm a Jedi but I don't show me

some gameplay then maybe I wouldn't be

ragging on the name of the game because

that's really all you've given me is a

with rose petals now shitty name no I

disagree uh what they gave us was a

concept and I think it's a really neat

interesting name the concept something

that's related to the visual concept

you're showing me

but how here's the thing how much how

many times are they going to be able to

do the same game underwater over and

over again I'm not a bank in the loop

but come up with a new name for it sky

city would be better than Bioshock I

have no problem with the new Bioshock

game actually I think it looks good in

it and despite the fact that I hate the

other Bioshock games I might play it and

I'm going to say I might play it despite

the fact trailer sucks has no gameplay

in it and the title meaningless it is

kind of me you might as well call it it

NFL football 2011 Sky City well no that

would have made more sense because it

had Sky City in it I just think infinite

what does that have to do with anything

I know hopefully it's gonna be something

I did not see an infinite world that guy

was clearly falling to the ground there

hadn't the arms on it he was gonna eat

on porn right before he well and the

thing is even the concept of infinity

the human mind can't even fathom it so

why even bother is actually not Adams

mind which is no any mind you draw in

the same small town

what do you work why'd you bring up

gerbils what have you what if people

told you
