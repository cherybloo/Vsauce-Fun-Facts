Using GPS, these trails represent pizza delivery
in Manhattan on a typical Friday night.

And is this a frog or a orse?

It's episode 52 of IMG!

This lemon looks yellow to me, and it probably
looks yellow to you as well, but not in

the same way. You see, here in this room,
this lemon is "Subtractively Yellow." It absorbs

all visible wavelengths of light except for
yellow light, which it reflects onto my retina.

But the screen that you are using to watch
this video doesn't produce yellow light at

all. In fact, it can only produce red, blue,
or green light. The really cool, but kind

of disturbing thing about this is that here
in the room, I am actually seeing "real" yellow

light. But you are seeing "fake" yellow. Absolutely
no yellow is coming off your screen and falling

onto your retina. But it still looks yellow
because it's quite easy to lie to the brain.

Our retinas contain three different types
of cone cells that are receptive to color

and each one is best suited to detect a certain
color. One is great for blue, the other is

great for green and the third is great for
red. Notice that there is no individual cell

looking for yellow. So, the way we actually
see yellow happens like this. The wavelength

of yellow light falls between the wavelengths
of red and green. And, so, when an object

reflects yellow light onto your retina, both
the green and the red cones are slightly activated,

which your brain notices and says "well, that's
what happens when something's yellow, so it

must be yellow."

All a computer monitor or a mobile phone screen
has to do to make you think you're seeing

yellow is send a little bit of red and a little
bit of green light at you. As long as the

pixels and the little subpixels on them are
small enough that you can't distinguish them

individually, your brain will just say "well,
I'm recieving some red and some green, that's

what yellow things do...hmm...it must be yellow."
Even though it actually is not...

Lemons can also produce electricity. A little
bit of zinc, a little bit of copper, and boom,

you're moving electrons around. But not that
many, I mean, the current voltage are quite

low.
You could run an LCD, but even a potato could do that...

If you wanted to run a flashlight bulb, that
would take 3,000 lemons. And if you wanted

to run a halogen bulb, well, that would take
37,000 lemons. But artist Caleb Charland

doesn't care.

He spent 11 hours hammering nails into 300
living apples hanging on trees. By connecting

them to a household lamp, he was able to make
it glow just dimly enough to capture this

image with a 4 hour exposure.

Less alive and more frightening are Steve
Shaheen's sculptures: little dudes with bulb

heads desperately trying to plug themselves in.

Merve Kahraman's "Revitalizer" never dies.
It's a lightbulb surrounded by wax. Now, the

wax melts because of the lightbulbs heat,
and drips into a special container into all

kinds of weird new shapes, but whenever you
want you can just flip it so that the new,

cooled wax is at the top.

But my favorite is the Fukusada wooden lightbulb.
It looks like a solid block of wood, but it's

actually hollow and chipped to a nearly paper-thin
width. When you turn it on you can see the

light coming from inside.

Combos.

Artist Tang Yau Hoong blew my mind this week.
We've got clear days and smoke, boats and

crocs, whales and hearts, Pie-bike, brains
and boxing gloves, day and night, but don't

be scared, you can always paint yourself some
light. Or just swing on some light.

Ok, let's frame it this way. Climbing Wall.
This fitness club in Japan uses frames and

other pretty interior elements to create a
decidedly less rugged climbing wall.

But let's get simple. Like, minimal.

Thanks to Lego, here are their bricks arranged
to represent famous characters. Enjoy.

Now for some Art Illusions.

Here's a cute couple, but can you see, in
this very same image, the baby they will soon

have? Or how about these zebras? There's
a lion hiding amongst them. Can you find it?

Billboards can be clever, but here's a great
one that makes it look like someone is pushing

out a section of the building.

But how many of you will remember seeing it?
If we assume that you don't remember experiencing

major cultural events before you're 5 or 6
years old, that means that every year there

are fewer and fewer people alive who remember
experiencing recent historical events.

xkcd made this amazing chart to show when,
in the future, the majority, more than half

of living americans, will not remember being
alive when certain things happened. For instance,

he calculated using data from the US Census
Bureau that 2012, this very year, is the

first year in American history since in which
fewer than half of living Americans remember

being alive in the 1970's.

By 2041, most of us won't remember a time
when Pluto was actually called a planet. By

2043, most of us alive won't remember living
during George W. Bush's presidency. And by

2047, more than half of living Americans
will not have been alive to have remembered

anything that you did today.

Like when you made that funny face in the
yearbook. No, no, no, THAT funny face.

If you're not following @tweetsauce, you're
missing out on daily Vsaucey content, most

of which never makes it to a video. So go
follow us on Twitter and I'm gonna leave you

with another combo. A tessellation, while you
listen to Jake Chudnow's "Flan." He made a

music video for this song over on his channel,
so check that out.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
