hey Vsauce and wacky gamer fans it's

Jeff fragment from nerd wars we're

trying something different this week

we're going over your comments on John

McClane versus Indiana Jones don't

forget to comment on the videos cuz we

may highlight them the next week's nerd

wars straight from our Facebook page

Facebook Mikey gamer comm is Voldemort

from Harry Potter the villain versus

Gandalf from Lord of the Rings but

they're home

so let's get to the comments this was a

good point us can't a fighter

are we talking pre crystal skull Andy or

after during I'm assuming at their prime

I'm gonna say yes definitely at their

prime he goes on to say I'm gonna have

to give it to Indy just barely though

it's if it's both of them fighting

during the fourth movies John McClane

all the way he doesn't seem to lose

anything by the fourth movie in D gets

lame and he does get lame and how much

of that has to do with Harrison Ford

just getting older and being more of a

horrible actor I don't know he was

delivering his lines like he was stone

the whole time hey everybody welcome to

nerd wars today we're doing John McClane

versus Indiana Jones but first we want

to do the call to action for next week

the next arguments gonna be Baltimore

thinks gonna win Batman but also make

Covenant was opened Indiana Jones
