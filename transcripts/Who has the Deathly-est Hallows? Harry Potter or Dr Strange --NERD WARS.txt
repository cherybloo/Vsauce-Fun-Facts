you go down the little alley and then

you can go right into what and buying

you know what everything supplies I've

been the Hogwarts it's awesome Harry

Potter's villains are all teachers dr.

strange has a doctor his villains are

not teachers who are his village

Voldemort is not a teacher never was a

Hogwarts teacher let's try a Hogwarts

student Oh

bernd fact win Jeff you know and don't

wear horses over Baltimore Baltimore

superpowers having no nose how was that

a superpower it's not a superpower and

that was an interpretation of the book

you know Jeff yes you should be arguing

for dr. strange because you have the

same gay facial hair that he does which

is why dr. strange would win right

Beverly our only argument is this

patient we are so awesome because I win

all these nerd wars everyone owes that

win the nerd war that when the world

otter doesn't even have magical powers

traveling through time do for you

nothing you actually got to be able to

do something know you've done no crap go

back in time time and kill JK Rowling's

I just read that all right freakin

spider-man comic book where he took

spider-man back in time yeah how's it go

prevent something and you know who did
