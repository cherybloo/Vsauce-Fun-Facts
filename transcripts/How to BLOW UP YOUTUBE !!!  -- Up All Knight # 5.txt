hello Vsauce today we've got a new

episode of up all night where I show off

my favorite geeky and techie pranks

first just in time for April Fool's Day

we've got two Wiggly calm now be careful

because when you go there it causes your

browser window to do this to stop it

just press ctrl W on a PC or command W

on a Mac for a better scare there's the

infamous blue screen of death

screensaver for you Mac users out there

no worries you can grab a kernel panic

screensaver that's even animated to

scroll down like the real thing for less

terror and more fun let's talk

JavaScript skater haha one showed me

this and it blew my mind by copying and

pasting code number one from this

video's description in your address bar

you can actually play the game asteroids

against whatever website you're on or

turn up the brooding by using code

number to this code inverts color so you

can show off your exclusive access to

youtube black or hate Facebook Gogh if

you prefer blue and red use code number

three to make a page full of images work

with 3d blue and red glasses and by the

way you can reset all of this stuff by

just pressing refresh now here's

something actually useful a project from

Mark Beasley that creates a snowstorm

out of tweets containing the word you

put after the equal sign for instance

here's one where you can see people

talking about Vsauce Beasley doesn't

stop there this site records and

broadcasts the locations of the cursor

of everyone on it so hearing him this

morning it was just me and my friend in

the other room but go there now I'll be

there I'll be the one making little V's

for Vsauce let's make automatic art this

site takes the title you give your work

and then searches Google Images for a

number of pics and then randomly edits

crops and layers each time you click

create it generates a new random design

based on the words you put in the title

speaking of Google Image Search here is

its opposite 10 i com allows you to

enter an image and then find out where

else on the web that image is it's a

great way to find larger versions or to

find out whose copy now a submission

from crazy taco a 3d video but like

really you can try it out by following

the link in the description and while

watching the video click and drag your

mouse to move around so that the camera

is pretty much your head I've got a new

episode of Luke coming out tomorrow so
