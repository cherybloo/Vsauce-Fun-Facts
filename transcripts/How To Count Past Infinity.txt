hey vsauce michael here what is the

biggest

number you can think of a google

a google plex a

millimillion olplex well

in reality the biggest number is

40. covering more than 12 000 square

meters of earth

this 40 made out of strategically

planted

trees in russia is larger than the

battalion markers on signal hill

in calgary the six found on the foven

badges in

england even the mile of pie

brady unrolled on numberphile

40 is the biggest number

on earth in terms of surface area but in

terms of amount of things

which is normally what we mean by a

number being big

40 probably isn't the biggest

for example there's 41.

yeah well and then there's 42 and 43

a billion a trillion you know no matter

how big of a number you can think of

you could always go higher so there is

no

biggest last number

except infinity no

infinity is not a number instead it's a

kind of number

you need infinite numbers to talk about

and compare

amounts that are unending but some

unending amounts

some infinities are literally bigger

than others let's visit some of them

and count past them first things first

when a number refers to how many things

there are

it is called a cardinal number for

example

4 bananas 12 flags

20 dots 20 is the

cardinality of this set of dots

now two sets have the same cardinality

when they contain the same number of

things we can demonstrate this equality

by pairing

each member of one set one to one with

each member of the other

same cardinality pretty simple we use

the natural numbers that is 0 1 2 3 4 5

and so on as cardinals whenever we talk

about

how many things there are but how many

natural numbers are there it can't be

some number in the naturals because

there'd always be one plus that number

after it

instead there's a unique name for this

amount

aleph null aleph is the first letter

of the hebrew alphabet and aleph null is

the first

smallest infinity it's how many natural

numbers there are

it's also how many even numbers there

are how many odd numbers there are

it's also how many rational numbers that

is fractions

there are that may sound surprising

since

fractions appear more numerous on the

number line but as cantor showed

there's a way to arrange every single

possible rational

such that the naturals can be put into a

one-to-one correspondence with them

they have the same cardinality

point is aleph null is a big

amount bigger than any finite amount

a google a googleplex a googleplex

factorial to the power of a googleplex

to a googleplex

squared times gram's number

aleph null is bigger

but we can count past it how

well let's use our old friend the

supertask

if we draw a bunch of lines and make

each next line

a fraction of the size and a fraction of

the distance from

each last line well we can fit an

unending number of lines

into a finite space the number of lines

here

is equal to the number of natural

numbers that there are

the two can be matched one to one

there's always a next

natural but there's also always a next

line

both sets have the cardinality out of

null

but what happens when i do this

now how many lines are there aleph null

plus one no unending amounts

aren't like finite amounts there are

still only aleph null lines here because

i can match the naturals one to one just

like before

i just start here and then continue from

the beginning

clearly the amount of lines hasn't

changed

i can even add two more lines three more

four more i always end up with only

aleph null things i can even add another

infinite aleph null of lines

and still not change the quantity every

even number can pair with these and

every odd number

with these there is still a line for

every natural

another cool way to see that these lines

don't add to the total

is to show that you can make this same

sequence without drawing

new lines at all just take every other

line and

move them all together to the end it's

the same thing

but hold on a second this and this

may have the same number of things in

them but clearly there's

something different about them right i

mean if it's not how many things they're

made of

what is it well let's go back to having

just one line

after an aleph null sized collection

what if instead of matching the naturals

one to one we insist on numbering each

line

according to the order it was drawn in

so we have to start here

and number left to right now

what number does this line get in the

realm of the infinite

labeling things in order is

pretty different than counting them you

see this line doesn't contribute to the

total

but in order to label it according to

the order it appeared in

well we need a set of labels of numbers

that extends past the naturals

we need ordinal numbers the first

trans-finite ordinal is omega

the lowercase greek letter omega this

isn't a joke or a trick

it's literally just the next label

you'll need after using up the infinite

collection of every single county number

first

if you got omegath place in a race

that would mean that an infinite number

of people finished the race

and then you did after

omega comes omega plus one which

doesn't really look like a number but it

is just like two or twelve or

eight hundred then comes omega plus two

omega plus three ordinal numbers

label things in order ordinals aren't

about how many things there are

instead they tell us how those things

are arranged

their order type the order type of a set

is just the first ordinal number not

needed to label everything in the set

in order so for finite numbers

cardinality and order type are the same

the order type of all the naturals is

omega

the order type of this sequence is omega

plus one

and now it's omega plus two no matter

how

long an arrangement becomes as long as

it's well ordered

as long as every part of it contains a

beginning element

the whole thing describes a new

ordinal number always

this will be very important later on

it should be noted at this point that if

you are ever playing a game of

who can name the biggest number and you

are considering

saying omega plus one you should be

careful

your opponents might require the number

you name to be a

cardinal that refers to an amount these

numbers

refer to the same amount of stuff just

arranged

differently omega plus one isn't

bigger than omega it just comes

after omega but aleph null

isn't the end why

well because it can be shown that there

are infinities

bigger than aleph null that literally

contain

more things one of the best ways to do

this is with cantor's

diagonal argument in my episode on the

bonnatarsky paradox

i used it to show that the number of

real numbers

is larger than the number of natural

numbers

but for the purposes of this video let's

focus on another thing

bigger than alec nol the power set

of aleph null the power set of a set

is the set of all the different subsets

you can make from

for example from the set of one and two

i can make a set of nothing or

one or two four

one and two the power set of one two

three

is the empty set one and

two and three and one and two

and one and three and two and three and

one two three as you can see

a power set contains many more members

than the original set

two to the power of however many members

the original set had

to be exact so what's the

power set of all the naturals

well let's see imagine a list of every

natural number cool now the subset of

all say

even numbers would look like this yes

no yes no yes no and so on the subset of

all

odd numbers would look like this

here's the subset of just 3 7 and 12.

and how about every number except 5

or no number except five

obviously this list of subsets is going

to be

well infinite but imagine matching them

all

one-to-one with a natural

if even then there's a way to keep

producing

new subsets that are clearly not listed

anywhere here we will know that we've

got a

set with more members than there are

natural numbers

a bigger infinity than aleph null

the way to do this is to start up here

in the first

subset and just do the opposite of what

we see

0 is a member of this one so our

new set will not contain zero next

move diagonally down to one's membership

in the second subset

one is a member of it so it will not be

in our new one

two is not in the third subset so it

will be in

hours and so on

[Music]

as you can see we are describing a

subset that will be

by definition different in at least one

way

from every single other subset on this

aleph null

sized list even if we put this new

subset back in

diagonalization can still be done the

power set

of the naturals will always resist a

one-to-one correspondence

with the naturals it's an infinity

bigger than aleph null repeated

applications of power set

will produce sets that can't be put into

one-to-one correspondence with the last

so it's a great way to quickly produce

bigger and bigger infinities

the point is there are more cardinals

after

aleph null let's try to reach them

now remember that after omega ordinals

split and these numbers are no longer

cardinals

they don't refer to a greater amount

than the last cardinal we reached

but maybe they can take us to one

wait what are we doing

aleph null omega

come on we've been using these numbers

like

there's no problem but if at any point

down here

you can always add one always

can we really talk about it this endless

process as a totality and then follow it

with something

of course we can this is math

not science the things we assume to be

true in math

are called axioms and an axiom we come

up with

isn't more likely to be true if it

better explains or predicts

what we observe instead it's true

because we say it is its consequences

just become what we observe we are not

fitting our theories to some physical

universe

whose behavior and underlying laws would

be the same

whether we were here or not we are

creating

this universe ourselves

if the axioms we declare to be true lead

us to contradictions

or paradoxes we can go back and tweak

them

or just abandon them all together or we

can just refuse to allow ourselves to do

the things that cause the paradoxes

that's it what's fascinating though is

that in making sure the axioms we accept

don't lead to problems we've made math

into something that is as the saying

goes

unreasonably effective in the natural

sciences

so to what extent we're inventing all of

this

or discovering it it's hard to say

all we have to do to get omega

is say let there be omega

and it will be good that's what ernest

zermelo did in 1908 when he included the

axiom of infinity in his list of

axioms for doing stuff in math the axiom

of infinity is simply the declaration

that one infinite set

exists the set of all

natural numbers if you refuse to accept

it

that's fine that makes you a finitist

one who believes only

finite things exist but if you accept it

as most mathematicians do you can go

pretty far past these

and through these eventually we get to

omega plus omega except

we've reached another ceiling going

all the way out to omega plus omega

would be to create another

infinite set and the axiom of infinity

only guarantees that this one exists

are we going to have to add a new axiom

every time we describe aleph null more

numbers no the axiom of replacement can

help us here

this assumption states that if you take

a set like say the set of all natural

numbers

and replace each element with something

else

like say bananas what you're left with

is also a set that sounds simple but

it's incredibly useful

try this take every ordinal up to omega

and then instead of bananas put omega

plus

in front of each now we've reached omega

plus omega

or omega times two using replacement

we can make jumps of any size we want so

long as we only use numbers we've

already

achieved we can replace every ordinal up

to omega

with omega times it to reach omega times

omega

omega squared we're cooking now

the axiom of replacement allows us to

construct

new ordinals without end eventually

we get to omega to the omega to the

omega to the omega to the omega

and we run out of standard mathematical

notation

no problem this is just called epsilon

not

and we continue from here but now

think about all of these ordinals

all the different ways to arrange alec

null things

well these are well ordered so they have

an order type some ordinal that comes

after all of them in this case

that ordinal is called omega 1.

now because by definition omega 1 comes

after

every single order type of aleph null

things

it must describe an arrangement of

literally

more stuff than the last aleph i mean if

it didn't

it would be somewhere in here but it's

not

the cardinal number describing the

amount of things

used to make an arrangement with order

type omega one

is aleph one it's not known where the

power set of the naturals

falls on this line it can't be between

these cardinals

because well there aren't cardinals

between them it could be equal to aleph

one

that belief is called the continuum

hypothesis but it could also be larger

we just don't know the continuum

hypothesis by

the way is probably the greatest

unanswered question in this entire

subject

and today in this video

i will not be solving it but i will be

going higher and higher to bigger

and bigger infinities now using the

replacement axiom we can take any

ordinal we've already reached

like say omega and jump from

aleph to aleph all the way out to al of

omega

or heck why not use a bigger ordinal

like omega squared

to construct alef omega squared alef

omega omega omega omega omega omega

our notation only allows me to add

countably many

omegas here but replacement doesn't care

about whether or not i have a way to

write the numbers it reaches

wherever i land will be a place of even

bigger numbers

allowing me to make even bigger and more

numerous jumps

than before the whole thing is a wildly

accelerating

feedback loop of ambiguity we can keep

going like this

reaching bigger and bigger infinities

from below

replacement and repeated power sets

which may or may not line up with the

aleps

can keep our climb going forever

so clearly there's nothing beyond them

right not so fast that's what we said

about getting past the finite

to omega why not accept as an axiom

that there exists some next number so

big

no amount of replacement or power

setting on anything smaller

could ever get you there such a number

is called

an inaccessible cardinal because you

can't

reach it from below now interestingly

within the numbers we've already reached

a shadow

of such a number can be found aleph null

you can't reach this number from below

either

all numbers less than it are finite

and a finite number of finite numbers

can't be added multiplied exponentiated

replaced with finite jumps a finite

number of times or even

power set a finite number of times to

give you anything

but another finite amount

sure the power set of a millimillion to

a googleplex to a googleplex to a

googleplex

is really big but it's still just finite

not even close to aleph null

the first smallest infinity

for this reason aleph null is often

considered an inaccessible number

some authors don't do this though saying

an inaccessible must also be uncountable

which okay makes sense i mean we've

already accessed

alec null but remember the only way we

could

is by straight up declaring its

existence axiomatically

we will have to do the same for

inaccessible cardinals

it's really hard to get across just how

unfathomable the size of an inaccessible

cardinal is

i'll just leave it at this the

conceptual jump

from nothing to the first infinity

is like the jump from the first infinity

to an inaccessible set theorists have

described numbers

bigger than inaccessibles each one

requiring a new

large cardinal axiom asserting its

existence

expanding the height of our universe of

numbers

will there ever come a point where we

devise an axiom implying the existence

of so many things

that it implies contradictory things

will we someday answer the continuum

hypothesis

maybe not but there are promising

directions

and until then the amazing fact remains

that many of these infinities perhaps

all of them are so big it's

not exactly clear whether they even

truly exist

or could be shown to in the physical

universe

if they do if one day physics finds a

use for them

that's great but if not

that's great too that would mean that we

have

with this brain a tiny thing

a septillion times smaller than the tiny

planet it lives on

discovered something true outside of the

physical realm

something that applies to the real world

but is also strong enough to go

further past what even the universe

itself can contain

or show us or be

and as always thanks for watching

[Music]

oh

[Music]

[Music]

another interesting fact about

transfinite ordinals

is that arithmetic with them is a little

bit different

normally two plus one is the same as one

plus

two but omega plus one is not the same

as one plus omega one plus omega

is actually just omega think about them

as order types

one thing placed before omega just

uses up all the naturals and leaves us

with order type omega

one thing placed after omega requires

every natural number and then omega

leaving us with omega plus one as the

order type
