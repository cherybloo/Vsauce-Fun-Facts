this is Jeff wman I don't know where

Adam is but we're bringing you another

nerd

Wars this one's coming from hello master

chief it's Boba Fett versus Deadpool I

will do the opening Gambit uh right here

uh there's no way that Boba Fett could

stop Deadpool simply because I'm just

going to put this out right now Deadpool

has a healing Factor like you can

decapitate Deadpool he has a healing

Factor you know how many times you've

used that argument he's you

every week no I this is the first time

he's got a healing Factor Thor's got a

healing factor I never said that

Daredevil's got a healing fact

Superman's got a healing Factor

Wolverine's got a healing Factor there

that one was right here's the thing

Deadpool has been liquidized numerous

times actually melted down and turned

into liquid still regroups reforms and

comes back for more I got one word for

you what's that

Mandalorian it isn't that an 18th

century musical instrument got

Mandalorian armor he just kicks him ass

he's the son of Dango Fett so so

basically you're saying that uh because

his dad's badass Boba Fett can beat him

up yeah I got news no it's a badass

breeding program all Boba Fett has to do

is collect that liquid in a tiny little

container put it on slave one and just

shoot it out in the space and 20 years

later Deadpool would come back and kick

his ass luckily they're both mortal so

they'd be dead 20 years from now ah

sorry all cool people die before they

hit senior citizens sorry dude Deadpool

with his healing factor means that he

really doesn't age same as Wolverine

blam another point for Deadpool healing

Factor has nothing to do with aging yes

it does the body keeps healing instead

of deteriorating I'm going to edit it so

I win and that's how it's going to work

I hate the fact that you do all the

editing some people started to notice

that yeah yeah you see it's all

one-sided like right now right now

here's going to be the worst picture you

can imagine of uh Deadpool and now

here's a really Kick-Ass picture of Boba

Fett yeah well that's how the editing

Works see the thing is you can't find a

non- kickass picture of Boba Fett

because he's that badass he's got a

jetpack I don't Deadpool going around a

jet pack he came out of the sarlac pit

whatever he survived the sarlac really

we're going to play that game oh yeah so

yeah he he did die in the starac pit

until 20 until 20 years later when

George Lucas decided that he should live

because he's marketable die no that was

in the books whatever you know you know

what you can do you read a book there's

a whole series of novels of Boba Fett

I'm going to I'm going to become the

most popular guy on this uh website by

saying those novels suck yeah why don't

you go read a dumbass Deadpool comic

here's don't you say here's here's a

little point he's a trained assassin

so's Boba Fett no he's a bounty hunter

Boba Fett's got years and he has to deal

with far creepier people than Deadpool

ever has to do Deadpool's an assassin

Boba Fett's a bounty hunter and I have

watched Dog the Bounty Hunter and

there's nothing intimidating ating about

a bounty hunter oh that mullet what are

you talking about there you go the the

most intimidating thing about Dog Bounty

Hunter his wife Nails his wife's Nails

exactly and the boobs they're like

Wolverine's claws mhm yeah maybe if Boba

Fett had the fat big breasted wife that

doged the Bounty Hunter has I'd give the

point how we know he doesn't they really

don't go over it do you know how many

dead times Deadpool's died zero no one

can kill Boba Fett no no they did Kill

Boba Fett no they didn't yeah they did

they threw him in a starac pit and he

came out and then there was and then

there was a

book oh so you're going to say oh there

was that first book Deadpool was in and

then there was another book that doesn't

matter because I'm declaring for my

argument that these those books don't

matter if if you want we could find some

fan picks of Deadpool banging Princess

Leia doesn't mean it happened tell us

how much ass Deadpool would kick this

fight or how badass Boba Fett is because

he's the most badass bounty hunter in

the universe you just like him cuz he f

weap
