of Honor the new video game thing I

don't understand play with a compass and

a map play with a gun in a sack play

fun and games to you with your battery

operated dildo guns shooting at

invisible enemies while me and my

friends got real Medals of Honor in WW2

Arts so what did you think think you

didn't even show the video game that was

fake and stupid gentlemen I think we can

all agree that that commercial sucked
