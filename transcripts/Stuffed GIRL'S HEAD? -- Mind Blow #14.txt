a water-powered jetpack and step right

up get just stuff girl heads Vsauce

Kevin here this is my flow this super

Jen and Tory blew everyone away in 2000

made by combining an Atari 2600 Genesis

NES and Super NES into one sexy package

but let's scale it all back with this

cartridge console it's a functioning NES

built inside a copy of Super Mario

Brothers oh and if you want to build

your own click the link below for

detailed instructions now there's

nothing like enjoying a can of marbs and

a pack of soup these living turds are

actually magnetic gels that someday

could be used for artificial robot

muscles and these glowy tree pods are

designed to convert co2 to oxygen

without requiring soil and water they're

made from recycled plastic drinking

models have solar panels instead of

leaves and seesaws so little Billy can

build up kinetic energy my only question

is why is this girl

leaning if you want to enjoy the great

outdoors but love being inside bubbles

just buy a bubble tree tent they have

several varieties including treehouse

desk and too many marbles are a good

excuse for marble machines this guy has

a ton of these with different lifts

drops and obstacles many of which are

interchangeable and if you want a simple

and design yet highly addictive puzzle

game check out block drop let me know

avatar that lets you experience life

through the mic and camera attached to
