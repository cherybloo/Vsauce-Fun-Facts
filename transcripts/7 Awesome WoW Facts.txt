hey Vsauce Michael here with a special

fact filled video celebrating World of

Warcraft and cataclysm now even if

you've never played the game I've got

seven awesome things that are sure to

titillate tiate so much in fact I had to

bring in some friends to help I've got

Chad and Angie from the screen team show

hi Michael hi bauce I don't know how you

enter like that it's a Head Rush all

right first of all wow is filled with a

ton of great hidden images like the word

help written on top of a mountain

Northeast of thunderbluff there's a

dinosaur St crater in the outlands and

there's these mountains near hammerfall

that from the right angle say

LOL or the fact that if you zoom out far

enough in the valley of Honor you can

see that the whole thing is actually

Mickey Mouse all right but let's be

serious for a second guys the most

important hidden image and wow is this

rock formation in the

Barons uh sorry here's an image that

actually came from

facebook.com/vsaucegaming it's a it's

not inside Azeroth but it was made out

of stuff inside it it's a mosaic of the

Wild logo built out of a whole bunch of

action icons from the game okay I really

love this one the punch cards that you

get in neron are not just decorative the

data that's in them is binary code for

all sorts of funny sentences and when

you translate them uh the white card

says th and Jana sitting in a tree k i

SS i n g it well it reads that it

doesn't really sing but some of the

cards are serious like the code on the

Prismatic card it actually translates to

say message to cast pipe your laundry is

ready for pickup wow has always had a

share of inside jokes like Harrison

Jones or the book in Evan hold that list

your own character's name with the

Judgment needs more cowbell that one I

didn't know I want to go there and see

my character's name another one they

just added recently was you remember the

red shirt guy from BlizzCon 2010 he

stumped the developers with a crazy

question and blew everybody's mind and

they were like oh we'll have to check on

that while they recently put him in the

game he's standing in Iron Forge and his

name is the fact

Checker exactly and one of the newest

and most fun references is plans versus

Zombies in the Hills bread Foothills you

can accept a quest that recreates the

game and it gives you a chance to win a

grening sunflower pet yes yes isn't that

incredible uh did you guys know Chad

stop talking because I have to tell you

something very important I grew up in

Kansas so the sunflower pet like

completes my life nice it sings it sings

in a little girl's voice like and it's

creepy but it looks cute let's switch

gears to physics you probably noticed

that when it's daytime in calor it's

daytime in the Eastern Kingdom so are

they on the same side of the planet or

is Azeroth flat well if you if you think

it's round like Earth then check out

this guy who did a geophysical survey of

the World of Warcraft by literally

measuring the world with human paces and

calculated its Gravity by timing his

female torren jumps he found that the

planet must be smaller than the Death

Star by quite a lot unless of course

there's an entire other side we haven't

seen future expansions hint hint I hope

so also on a related note a guy in the

comments of that video actually pointed

out that someone once calculated that

Ultima Online is about the size of

Disney World so if you like those facts

great but if you wish you were Dan no

problem you're in luck click right here

to view Chad and Angie's new music video

it's a spoof of Kanye West's runaway all

about cataclysm in World of Warcraft

check it out click it you'll love it I

love it it looks great and as always
