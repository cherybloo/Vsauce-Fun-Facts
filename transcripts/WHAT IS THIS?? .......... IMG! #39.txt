Mr. T with no hair and a baby giving the peace sign

in the womb.
It's episode of 39 IMG!

When tweety bird gets

old, you're gonna have this.
And it's amazing how little

information we need to see familiar objects.

It's also amazing than an iPhone can fall

13,500 feet from a sky diver's pocket

and still receive phone calls.
Well, this looks safe.

Oh.
And this looks sad.

Oh. This looks cool. Ohhhh.
This rock

is sad and so is food like this pear.

I mean, how could you eat such sad food?
Try a hot dog instead.

No, no, no. A hot dog, like really hot.

Pepperoni sweater hot.
Prefer your dog to be a mouse pad?

Well, you might also prefer your rock paper
scissors to be more complex.

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is popular,

but there's also Pirate Zombie Monkey
Ninja Robot or

this game which uses 15 different

items.
And don't worry, there's also RPS25.

Each item has an equal chance of winning

and yes, there are explanations for each.
If remembering 25 items is too much,

don't worry, there is a flash game version.

Here's a Middle Earth Map dress and is
that Steve Buscemi on your dress or are

you just really saggy to see me?

Sorry if that came across like a pickup line.
It's just

I mustache you a question.
Can eyebrows

your computer?
Alright, look, no more puns. At least

not until after the soap opera.
BuzzFeed showcased some

unnecessary signs.
"Keep off the

grass" and yeah, no one has to tell me that.

So instead, here are some famous people
eating ice cream.

Enjoy.

Let's get charty.
I love these two

huge charts.
One is all about the atom, the nucleus,

the distances electrons are away from it, fission, fusion.

It's great. And here's one from National
Geographic that puts our universe

in perspective.
This graph distributes rage faces

according to happy, sad and degree of

energy. Now, you'll never use the wrong one.
And these maps show the most popular

first

names by country.
The greasy stain on this receipt has a man's

face in it. And these chairs look like they're sinking.

Their bottom halves have been painted
as a projection like shadows,

so that from the right angle
they come together. This

is the Firefox logo and this

is V838 Monocerotis, possibly

the largest star known to man.
I leave you

with 241543903.
