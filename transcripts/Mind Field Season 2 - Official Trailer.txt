 Understanding
 of the human mind

 isn't complete unless it
 considers everything

the brain is capable of.

♪♪

When is it okay to risk harm
in the name of science?

♪♪

I'm about to find out.

♪♪

I'm a little anxious about
what's about to happen.

This will probably be
a little bit uncomfortable.

And my job?

I'm the lab rat.

 I'm about to head up
 the Amazon to drink

 an ancient psychedelic drug.

I would suggest that

 you think about
 an emotional intention.

To make it emotional

is a lot more frightening
to me.

♪♪

 I started to see
 my body disappearing.

♪♪

 There was no going back.

 You're forced to see
 the world differently,

and by seeing the world
differently,

 it makes you think
 differently.

 What I wanna know is,

if we put them
in front of a switch,

 watching a train barrelling
 towards people,

 would they actually
 pull it?

I bet a lot of them
would freeze in that moment.

♪♪

 This isn't about
 having fun.

It's for science.

♪♪

I hope.
