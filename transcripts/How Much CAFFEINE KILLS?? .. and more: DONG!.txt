Vsauce. Are you still paying money for
things you have to wait to do in real

life?

Well, no worries, because I've got more free
stuff you can do online now, guys.

DONG. Lots of great suggestions from
WeSaucers today. First

from 'fippoolive', Google search.
Why be all floaty

when can use Google gravity? As soon as your mouse touches it, it collapses, but

remains usable. Is it too slow for you?
Well, try to kill yourself with caffeine.

This site suggested by 'illustr8r777'
lets you pick your favorite drink,

enter your weight and find out how many
energy drinks you'd have to drink

to die.
Before you do, use the energy to multitask.

This game comes from 'matti1310199'

and 'OVER9000ACCOUNTS'. As you play, more and more things come up that you have

to do.

Here I am using the left and right arrows to balance a ball,

up and down to avoid triangles and shift to jump.

Too much stress, too many buttons to push? Well, 'hall0fgamez'

asks us why not just hit your head
against a wall?

Press left then right over and over
again. The more times you hit your head,

the more freaked out and trippy the game becomes. Too simple?

Well, 'Sicvicious' thinks big - World's Biggest

Pac-Man. On this site you can choose
which board to play.

Everything's normal, except when you escape out the side you shift

to the next board. Once that game makes
you sick of Pac-Man, do the

opposite like 'ARealCoolUsername' - Anti Pac-Man.

Here, you play as a ghost and try to get Pac-Man. Of course,

when he turns you blue you've gotta run.
Now, I've been a fan of this site for a long

time. Girl Talk

makes great mashups and this site
visually lays out in real time

where every sample is coming from.
Take a look.

Well, make your own music on this site,
suggested by lots of WeSaucers.

Click a box and it will rhythmically generate a tone. Draw whatever you want.

For instance, this is the sound of Vsauce.

Or get symphonic with 'Killerzac's'
recommendation. You have to manipulate

arrows to direct

energy into boxes to hear new instruments.

Or be darker with Webby nominee 'Ana Somnia'.

This site uses your web cam to detect
brightness and you actually have to turn

out the lights or find a dark place

in order for her to dream. Now every
dream she has is unique

and completely crazy, but as soon as you
turn the lights back on or even

check your phone, she'll know and wake up

and end the dream.
Even more crazy is ÔúÅpsycho paint.

This site is also up for a Webby and
it let's you mimick the brushstrokes of great

painters

on your own pictures. Here's Lauren and I.
Let me just jazz it up a little over here

and there.

Beautiful.
I leave you with something new.

Vsauce Leanback. It's a playlist I hope to make

every week that contains videos from other
creators that I think are really cool.

The playlist lasts as long as an actual
television episode, so it's like

Vsauce, but grown-up. So if you ever wanna lean back and relax and let the videos

change themselves and have Vsauce be your tour guide,

check it out. There's a link in the description
and let me know what you think, because

I'm very interested to know.

And hey, as always,

thanks for watching.
