hey Vsauce Michael here do you want my

head delivered to your door in a box

well too bad I only have one head and I

already called dibs on it plus my neck

is like pure muscle this head ain't

never coming off the next best thing is

what actually comes in the curiosity box

by Vsauce it is chock full of science

gear designed by us it's pretty amazing

and a portion of all proceeds go to

Alzheimer's research so a subscription

isn't just good for your brain it's good

for all of our brains now if you

subscribe right now there's still time

to get this box the latest one it is

full of brain food including the topic

of this video a gyroscope if you hold a

gyroscope in the palm of your hand

upright like this it will fall over

that's not very surprising you see the

trick is to take the included string and

thread it through a hole and then spin

the disc around to the string wraps

around and around and around and around

once it's sufficiently wound up hold the

outside and give the string a firm pull

ah yeah now the gyroscope appears to

defy gravity the axis that spins around

is like glued in place almost cosmically

if you could get this to spin long

enough you could actually watch as that

access did move but not because it

actually moved because you and earth

moved around it that's actually where it

gets its name gyro scope you can use it

to scope watch the gyro gyration

rotation of the earth as l√©on foucault

did in 1852 when the device got its name

but how does it work

why are spinning things so stable also

watch this if I give it a good spin and

then hang it from its own string

sideways

it will remain parallel to the ground

but process around to get to the bottom

of what's up or whether as the cool kids

are saying nowadays begin by imagining

yourself swinging a ball around your

head on a rope even though the ball is

following a curved path its velocity is

at any given instant straight tangent to

its path you can demonstrate this to

yourself by letting go the ball will

shoot out at the velocity it had at the

moment you let go it doesn't curve away

or fly directly away while rotating the

rope keeps the ball always at the same

distance from the center which means

continuously changing the direction of

the balls velocity now that requires

force and in this case that force is

delivered by tension in the rope the

same intermolecular forces that attract

neighboring rope molecules to each other

and are the reason the rope doesn't just

disintegrate also resists the balls

momentum acting on it such that its

velocity changes every next instant so

as to always follow a circular path this

Center seeking force that acts on the

ball is called a centripetal force it

can be provided by a rope an entire disk

of material something invisible like

gravity or from the other side by a wall

or banked track side note notice that

there is no force acting on the ball

that goes directly outward away from the

center what we often hear called a

centrifugal or centrifugal force you

know the force you seem to feel when you

lock hands with someone and you both

spin around and you feel pulled straight

back

or when a car urine turns quickly and

you're suddenly thrown away from the

center the thing is this seemingly

outward directed force isn't a force at

all it's actually just an object's

inertia the path the object would take

if no other forces acted on it being

blocked by a force a centripetal force

across sufficiently short timescales an

inertial path can seem like it's

opposite a centripetal force but if

allowed to follow its inertial path for

a while the difference becomes more

clear here is a ball in orbit if the

centripetal force is removed it will

continue along on a path tangent to its

previous circular one the outline

represents where the ball would be if it

hadn't have been released now at first

the separation between the two appears

to occur directly away from the center

straight out but if allowed to continue

a more interesting path emerges from the

perspective of the outline which is

still moving counterclockwise the solid

ball appears to be receding and dragging

behind clockwise this is due to the

Coriolis effect which we will talk about

soon but first let's push some stuff

around it could really be anything but I

would love to use this ball it's very

cool it has fiber optic properties it

would be awesome to get these into

curiosity boxes down the line I will see

what I can do anyway if I push the ball

it will move in the direction of my

force pretty simple but if the ball is

moving before I touch it its velocity

doesn't just disappear instead both

combine and the ball moves according to

their sum the lower its initial momentum

the greater this angle now let's go back

to circular motion imagine a satellite

orbiting Earth its velocity is as we

showed before at all times tangent to

its circular path a centripetal force

from gravity continuously swings its

velocity around so that every 90 degrees

it starts pointing

more and more in the opposite direction

it used to be just like with the ball a

downwards force won't send it straight

down instead the vectors combine

resulting in a new path like this 90

degrees ahead it reaches the maximum

distance it will travel in the direction

of our force before going back the key

point here is that a downwards force at

this location didn't move the orbit like

this it moved the orbit like this

tilting it 90 degrees ahead of where we

acted now imagine the satellite as a

small piece of our gyroscope pushing

down here will cause the piece to assume

a path that would take it like this but

of course since the disk is solid in all

of its pieces quite rigidly push and

pull each other the gyroscope itself

tilts like this or if the gyro pivots

around a point below its center like

this if the gyro wasn't spinning pushing

it down here would have just caused this

to happen but when something is spinning

its component parts have other vectors

you need to consider

I learned a fun demonstration of this

from a great video by Matthias Wandel

this is a cardboard disc

I cut it out myself I can balance it on

the end of a pen just like this and if I

blow on the side nearest me it tilts to

me not very surprising but if the disc

is spinning and I blow in the same place

it tilts to the right and if I blow on

the side nearest you instead of tilting

to you well it tilts to the left if

instead of applying my force in one

location the whole time I instead apply

the force wherever the tilt is greatest

down well

the tilt will glide around and around

watch

[Music]

I've run out of air but the point is

this is exactly what is going on when a

gyroscope here on earth is spun up and

tilted the tilt glides around this is

called precession what's happening is

actually very similar to my breath

moving around except instead of my

breath it's gravity no matter how

perfectly upright a gyroscope is it will

not stay that way forever

any deviation no matter how slight will

allow gravity to form a torque a torque

occurs whenever a force rotates an

object around a pivot point if the disk

is spinning the effect of that torque

will move 90 degrees ahead in the

rotation like so but now the torque is

operating this way so its effect will

have to be felt 90 degrees ahead and so

on and well what do you know the

gyroscope processes now if it wasn't for

friction and air resistance and other

forces meddling with this disk it would

just process at the same angle forever

but of course well we live in a world

with friction and air resistance and all

that good stuff so the disk spins down

in the same way that a slower moving

ball is deflected with a steeper angle

as the disk slows down each piece of it

is given a steeper and steeper orbit

around the gyroscope tilts further and

further down until it hits the ground

and eventually slows to a stop take a

look at this bicycle wheel it's like our

gyroscope but bigger I have a string

tied to its handle right here so when

lifted like this a torque is applied by

gravity like so it's equivalent to a

force up here in this direction

and a force on the wheel down here in

this direction if I let go those two

forces will do their work okay pretty

predictable if I give this wheel

spinning there will be other vectors at

play a piece of the wheel moving say

counterclockwise or along with the rest

of the wheel down here will have a

velocity tangent to its circular path

but also a torque pushing it this way

that will cause its orbit like in our

gyroscope to move like this this force

will have its maximum impact 90 degrees

ahead in the rotation so the wheel will

turn like this but well there's still a

torque here pushing the bottom of the

wheel this way moving that 90 degrees

ahead we see that the wheel will just

keep turning and in fact that's what it

will do if I can get it up to a fast

enough speed then tada an even bigger

spinning object is the earth and we are

all on it strapped in by friction and

gravity for the ride a ride with some

surprising consequences a helicopter

can't just lift up off the ground remain

motionless and allow the earth to rotate

under it

doesn't work that way this is because

the helicopter the ground it used to be

on and the air all around it are all

also traveling with the Earth's spin but

if you had a magic paper airplane that

could be thrown really far and you

decided to throw it directly north to

your friend Earth's spin would come into

play no matter how dead-on your aim was

every time you would find that the plane

drifts a bit east as if pushed by some

mysterious force and likewise your

friend to the north would find that

their plane thrown south directly at you

would always drift a bit west this is

called the Coriolis effect you are both

on earth and you're both always north

and south of each

but in a day your friend nearer the pole

travels a shorter total distance around

it's less distance in the same time your

friend is moving slower than you your

plane meanwhile is spinning at your

faster velocity and it continues to have

this velocity after you throw it as it

moves towards the pole it finds itself

amongst slower and slower things so it

pulls ahead of them and drifts east in

the direction of Earth's spin your

friends playing meanwhile finds itself

amongst faster and faster moving things

that it falls behind there's a vertical

version of the Coriolis effect as well

an object suspended very high right up

above you will actually fall a bit to

the east

if dropped and anything you throw

straight up at it will curve away to the

west of it the higher up object whose

circular path around is bigger covers

more distance in the same time than you

these velocities don't just disappear

when things are dropped or thrown up so

you both miss your marks it's also why

the directly outward pointing force you

feel when spinning is fictitious your

inertial tendency to move in a straight

line takes you further from the path

you're on to where things have to have

higher velocities to rotate at the same

rate if you fly out long enough you'll

notice yourself falling behind your

original rotation pace not with it

always directly out finally lose weight

fast but not mass with this one weird

trick discovered by a Hungarian nobleman

and physicist people who think the earth

is flat hate him it's called the bush

effect in the early 1900's Baron Roland

von Hood Bush was looking at gravity

measurements taken on ships at sea and

noticed that readings were lower when

ships were travelling east and higher

when they were traveling west further

investigations found that yes in fact

when traveling on foot in a car on a

bike in a plane doesn't matter you weigh

less when traveling

and more when traveling west in fact an

airplane flying east at the equator

experiences an apparent weight reduction

of about 0.9 percent so if you want to

quickly lose a bit over a pound about

half a kilo get on that plane what

causes this effect well when you're

spinning with the earth you have a

linear velocity but gravity a

centripetal force is always resisting

this if gravity was turned off and the

earth remained whole you'd be flung off

on a tangent that rose above your usual

path for this reason your inertial

tendency to take this tangent path is a

sort of lift it's not enough to take you

off the surface earth doesn't spin fast

enough for that to happen but just as I

can lift something that's on a scale and

make it weigh less without completely

removing it from the scale so to does

your inertial path lift you just a bit

traveling east adds to the velocity

Earth's spin gives you and provides more

of this kind of lift in a direction away

from the surface making you lighter

conversely traveling west decreases your

velocity in that direction lowering its

lifting effect on your weight I will be

thinking about this and maybe even

weighing myself very precisely while I'm

traveling the country with brain candy

live you got your tickets already right

don't wait it is very very exciting and

I cannot wait to get a chance to see you

all in person and be more interactive

with this kind of stuff and do so on a

much bigger louder personal scale also
