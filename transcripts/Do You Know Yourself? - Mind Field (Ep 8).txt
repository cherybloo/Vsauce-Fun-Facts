but who are you?

Do you even know who you are?

 Are you your memories?

- I don't remember that.

- I don't remember that at all.

- Are you the choices you make?

The focus tester

is actually a magician.

- That's scary.

 - Or are you your past?

 ♪ ♪

Have you ever looked
at a photograph of yourself

and thought,
"That's what I look like?

Ugh."

We often think we look bad

or not right in photos

because photos show us
what we really look like

to other people.

The you that
you're used to seeing

is mirror you.

Every mirror you look into
reverses your face.

Most selfie cameras do this too,

so we tend to prefer
that version of ourselves.

If you wanna see yourself
in a mirror

the way other people see you
in real life,

take two mirrors

and position them
at a 90-degree angle.

What you see won't be
yourself reversed,

but how you look in real life.

 So who would you say
 you are really?

 Is it how you look?

 Or is it how you dress?

 Or are you the atoms
 that make you up?

Because all of those things
change throughout your life.

Ah, maybe
the real common thread,

that which doesn't change,

is your history,

your memory.

 But what if we remember things
 differently

from the way
they actually happened.

Does that mean
we don't know ourselves?

False memories are

frighteningly easy to create.

Today, we're gonna make some,

and we're gonna have
a little fun doing it.

We have created a fake game show

called "Who You Were."

We're gonna bring contestants
down memory lane

and have them tell us
about their past.

 Some of which we're going
 to completely make up.

We're gonna plant a few
little seeds in this mind field

and see if we can grow

some fake memories.

 [cheers and applause]

Hi, I'm Michael Stevens,

and welcome to the show

that takes you on a trip
down memory lane

from who you are

all the way back through...

"Who You Were."

Please welcome
today's very special guest,

Timothy DeLaGhetto.
- How's it going, man.

- Thanks for coming in.
- Thanks for having me.

- Excited to kinda
dive into some memories?

- Yeah, I don't really know
what to expect.

- To begin, though,
let's give the audience

a taste of your life.

- Oh, my God, let's take a look.

- So Tim was raised
in California

where he and his parents
owned and operated

a Thai food restaurant.
- [laughing]

- Tim found popularity
as a rapper,

comedian, actor,
and Internet personality,

and has attracted
over 3 million subscribers.

In order to--to kind of see
how you became who you are today

let's go back to who you were.
- Let's do it.

- We spoke to your parents...
- Mm-hmm.

- And they told us
some of their favorite memories

from when you were very,
very young.

- Okay.
 - I'm going to start

 with some true stories

 before I slip in
 the false memory.

When you were seven,

you were pretty much
held prisoner

by a very controlling
school girl.

The girl took control
of your life

and always wanted to know
what you were doing.

- I remember her.
Like, she was,

like, my--my best friend,
sort of,

but then she was also very,
like, possessive of me.

- But you guys aren't
together still.

- No, we might be
Facebook friends.

- Okay.
Here's a memory.

You weren't a crybaby
on the first day of school...

- Yeah.
- Until you noticed that

all the other kids were crying
and then you joined in.

- You know,
I empathize with people...

- Right.
- And, uh, I was just kind of,

like, helping them feel like
we were all a team.

 - Now here's the fake story

 we made up out of thin air.

Here's another memory.
- Mm-hmm.

- When you were about
four or five years old...

- Mm-kay.
- You actually took a ride

in a hot air balloon,
but you dropped something

from the balloon.

- I don't remember that at all.
[laughs]

- Really?
- Yeah, like, at all.

- We're going deep--far back.
- I didn't even know

I've ever been in
a hot air balloon

until you just reminded me.
- It was in Echo Park.

- Was it?
- Yeah.

- No clue.

 - Timothy is not accepting
 the story as truth yet.

 Time for our second subject.

 [xylophone trills]
 [upbeat music]

- Dylan, how are you?
- I'm doing great, man.

- You were, uh, inseparable

from you Superman cape
when you were young.

Once, you even tried
to use your super powers

to stop a car
driving down the street.

- Yeah, try to stop a car,
like, with my--with my hand

and everything.
- Did you succeed?

- You know,
the dude hit his brakes.

- Okay, next memory.

So when you were about
four or five years old,

you took a ride
in a hot air balloon

and you dropped something.

- Huh.

Uh...

I'm not sure
if I remember that to be honest.

 - Sometimes enriching
 the false story

 with a realistic detail
 can trigger the brain

to begin filling in the memory.
 Here goes.

Did you have a favorite toy
or anything

that maybe you had brought?

- Oh, I mean, I had, like,
some action figures, I think.

Um, I do remember,
like, losing one.

I'm not sure, like--that was,
like, the--what happened.

If I, uh, was
in a hot air balloon.

That's a crazy adventure

if I actually,
like, did something like that.

- Hi, Victoria.

When you were around
four or five years old,

you took a ride
in a hot air balloon

and you dropped something.

- I don't remember that.
- Four or five years old?

Up in the air?
- No.

- How many times you been
in a hot air balloon?

- None.

 - Of course
 none of the subjects

 remember the balloon ride.

 It never happened,

 but we are not done
 with them yet.

 24 hours from now,

 we'll take our subjects
 to Echo Park...

- Okay.

 - The site of their supposed
 childhood balloon ride,

 to see if any of
 the seeds I planted today

 have taken root.

This is where you took
your first hot air balloon ride.

- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

 [soft dramatic music]

We might not be able

to remember our past accurately
all the time,

but at least we have
direct insight

into our own mental states.

We know how we feel,

what we like,

and why.

Except we don't.

Psychologists call
our tendency to overvalue

how we explain our own behavior

while distrusting
that other people

truly understand their own...

An interesting manifestation
of this bias

is something called...

It is surprisingly easy

to fool someone into believing

they made a choice
that they never did,

and the amazing thing is that

they'll also defend
that fake choice

as if it were
what they had always wanted.

[film reel humming]

 We feel like
 we know ourselves pretty well.

 We know why
 we like the things we like.

 We know why we decided
 to do the things that we did.

 But do we?

 [dramatic music]

 Today, we'll be showing
 our subjects sets of photos

 and asking them
 to choose the photo

 of the person
 they'd prefer to work with.

 But this isn't exactly
 what it looks like.

The focus tester

is actually a magician

 who will be using
 slight of hand

 to swap
 some of the faces they choose

 for faces they've rejected.

Will they catch the trick?

 Or will they justify
 and explain a decision

they never actually made?

- Thank you for participating
in this study

of first impressions
in the workplace.

You will be shown sets of faces
and be asked to select

which person you would prefer
to work with.

Are you ready to begin?
- I am, yes.

- Cool.
So would you rather

work with person "A"
or person B?

- Person B.
- Person B.

 [soft dramatic music]

That's as complex as it gets.
- [laughs]

I can do this.
- Person "A" or Person B?

- Uh, B.

B.

"A."

B.

"A."
- Perfect.

So we've made a pile of
your ideal workplace colleagues.

Effectively.
- Okay.

- Uh, now part two is to--

if you could fill out the
"women in the workplace"

segment of the questionnaire.

- All of this business
about filling out a survey,

it's just to distract them
from what's about to happen

 because our magician
 is gonna make a swap.

 There it is.

 Two of the eight photos
 have been swapped out

 for pictures
 our subject rejected.

 What will she say
 when presented

 with photos of people
 she didn't actually choose?

- Now, on their own merits,
I wanna ask you

what it was about them
that made you pick them.

- Okay.
 - We'll start with a picture

 that she did pick
 before we slip in the rejects.

- So why did you want
to work with this person?

- She looks nice.
She looks really nice,

but I think the person
I compared her to

didn't look very friendly.
- Gotcha.

- Here's another pair of photos

 where she had
 a clear preference.

- Person B.
- Person B.

 - Now we're going to show her

 the picture
 she actually rejected.

- Why did you want
to work with this person.

- Um, she just looked nicer
than the other one.

[laughs]
- Yeah.

- That was one
where the other girl

didn't look very nice at all.

 - Is she just misremembering

 this one choice?

 How about another photo
 she rejected?

- Why did you prefer
to work with this person?

- She looks super sweet.

- So that was
what you were thinking

when you chose that--chose her?
- Mm-hmm.

I feel like she would be
one of those girls

that would, like,
on the birthdays

get you the card and...
[laughs]

She just looks really sweet.

 - This isn't just
 simple misremembering.

This is fabricating

a past that never happened.

 Will any of our other subjects

 justify choices
 that they never made?

- Person "A" or Person B?

- "A."

 - Now we'll present him
 with the photo he rejected.

- So why did you choose
to work with this person?

- She gave off the appearance

of a genuine person

who would be easy to work with.

- People are
completely fabricating

justifications
for things they never even did.

I think we could actually
up the ante.

We've been swapping
two of the eight faces,

 now we'll swap four.

 Let's see if she justifies

 the photos
 that she actually rejected.

- I liked her--her look.

I like to work
with confidant people,

so, to me, she looked like
a confident person.

As a woman,
I wanna, like,

help other women
grow and succeed

and give them advice

and I gravitated
towards that picture

because of that reason.

She looked like a type of person
you could confide in

and ask advice and learn
from her experiences.

So I think she had
that type of look.

She looks like she might be,
like, a wise type of person.

She looks confident.

So I think that's
why I picked her.

 - She seems so sure
 of her decisions,

 but let's give her
 one last look.

- In particular,
I'm curious about how you feel

about these four.

- You know,
there's the confidence

and, um, kindness,
and somebody young.

I feel like that would be

people I could work with, so...

I-I stand by my decisions.
- Cool.

- Yes...[laughs]
- Perfect.

- Yes.
- The interesting thing

about this study...
- Okay.

- Is they are not actually
the ones you chose.

- No?

- These ones were.
- Oh.

- They were switched
while you were filling in

the questionnaire.
It's this phenomenon,

what's known as
choice blindness.

If we think we made a choice,

we will find a way
to justify that choice...

- Ah.
- Even if we don't know

that's what we made.
- Okay.

I was trying to justify
these four...

[laughs]
'Cause I forgot

that I picked those four.
- It's like a debate.

Like, no matter what--
what side I was on,

I was gonna give reasons
for that.

I'm, uh, I'm not happy
that I did that,

but, um, that's the reason why.

- You pulled this
complete switcheroo on me,

and I wasn't even,
like, conscious about it.

That's scary.

So, Scott, you have

retrograde amnesia.

- Tell me what that is,
how it happened.

- I walked into a restroom
at my office building,

but I slipped on
an oily substance,

and hit the back of my head

and suffered, you know--

it was, like, four-
or five-inch laceration,

and that gave me
retrograde amnesia,

autobiographical

You still knew English.

You still knew things
like how to ride a bike.

That's a totally different
kind of memory.

both: Right.

- Well, when I handed him
a toothbrush,

he didn't comb his hair with it.

He put it in his mouth,

but he didn't know
what it was called.

- And you didn't remember

ever using one before?
- Correct.

- But you didn't have
the autobiographical memories

that involved toothbrushes,
but you knew how to operate it

'cause that's
a procedural memory.

- Right.
- Exactly, exactly.

- Wow.
- Things like that,

you know, are stored in
a different part of the brain.

- So it was almost like

you were--you were born

into this person's body
you didn't get to choose.

You have a name,
you have a wife,

you have a house,
you have a past...

- Mm-hmm.
- And you have to just accept

that all of those
are what you've been dealt.

- Right, 'cause that's exactly
how I felt.

Like I stepped
into somebody else's life,

and...

a lot of it I didn't believe.

I just couldn't picture that,
you know, I flew airplanes

 or--or was in the NFL.

I just--seemed like
nothing I would ever do,

and a lot of it, you know,
she had to prove to me.

She put together
a whole album full of pictures.

 She kind of put my life
 in a chronological order...

 - Wow.
 - And that kind of, you know,

 filled some of the gaps
 of who I was,

and I-I've heard that,
you know,

you are who you are

from the things
you've experienced

and your memories,

and when I hear that,

it's like a knife in my heart.

'Cause it's like,
"Then who am I?"

- So, Scott, when you're asked,
"Who are you?"

 An illuminating Harvard study

 found numerous examples
 of seemingly sane people

 who believed
 they had recovered memories

 of past lives
 and alien abductions,

 and there's no deceit.

 These people actually believe

 that these events occurred.

- And I remember I was
just literally scared to death.

 that a memory is real,

the brain can fill in details
that never happened.
