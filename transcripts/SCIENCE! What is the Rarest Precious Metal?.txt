Hey, Vsauce.
Michael here.

And I'm in Anaheim at VidCon.
I hope to see some of you here, because I

like you guys.
But I can't marry all of you.

But if I did put a ring on it, what is the
most precious thing you could make that ring

out of?
Silver, gold, platinum.

Those are all fine, but I wanna know what
is the rarest, most scarce thing on Earth

that's stable and safe to wear I could make
that ring out of.

And I want it to be pure.
I'm talking elemental.

Well, luckily, I recently went to the University
of Nottingham, home of Periodic Videos and

experimented with some elements.
First things first, zinc dissolved in mercury.

This stuff is awesome, it's dense, it's heavy,
it's liquid metal.

It's cool, but even cooler is human urine.
Thank you Neil.

Of course I am just kidding.
This is an aqueous solution of the metal vanadium.

And when we mix vanadium in with the mercury
and the zinc, the mercury helps the zinc give

electrons to the vanadium.
And is it gains more and more electrons, it

changes colour.
We're looking for purple.

I love shaking this, it's crazy, it's like
throwing me off balance.

It's so heavy.
Look at that.

Thank you electrons.

Those colours were beautiful, but vanadium

is not that rare.
I wanna get something more precious.

And how about precious personally, like my dad?

He's a chemical engineer who specifically
works with and has a patent concerning one

element.
Sulphur.

Of course a fun thing to do with sulphur is
to make it bark like a dog.

Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna take a glass tube and fill it

with laughing gas, nitrous oxide.
We're gonna pour a little bit of water into

the tube to cushion and protect the tube and
then we're gonna pour in some liquid carbon

disulphide.
It's very volatile and will evaporate, giving

us a mixture of gases inside this tube.
Finally, I will light the top of the tube,

causing the carbon disulphide to burn.
And as it burns, the temperature and pressure

in the tube will increase, causing the reaction
to go faster and faster.

It'll accelerate and bark.

Wow.

And look at all the sulphur on the sides of the tube.

That reaction was fun and cool and colourful,
but we're way off track here.

Even though sulphur is precious and dear to
my heart, it's not that rare at all.

So let's get crazy and talk about astatine.
Astatine is so rare here on Earth that we

don't even know what it looks like.
If you were to try to get enough astatine

atoms together that you could see it with
your own eyes, it would instantly vaporise

itself because of its radioactive heat.
The fact that it's so radioactive means it

wouldn't be great as a ring, so let's move
on to something a little bit more standard

and see where it takes us.
Gold.

Gold, of course, is famous for its un-reactivity,
which is why it's a great way to store your

wealth.
If you have a lot of gold laying around, the

likelihood that it will combine with other
elements and dissolve or rust or corrode is

basically zero,
with the exception of some special solutions.

In particular, one discovered in 1300s with
the fancy name "aqua regia."

It's made out of hydrochloric acid and nitric
acid and we're about to make some right now

thanks to Neil from Periodic Videos.
Of course, we're using this fume cover, because

the fumes that come off the nitric acid are
quite dangerous.

It's the gas NO2 and if you inhale it, nitric
acid forms in your lungs.

So instead of doing that, let's put some gold
in aqua regia.

We're just gonna use this ancient priceless
Egyptian relic.

Let's go ahead and try this out.
As the gold dissolves, what we wind up with

in the evaporating dish is chloroauric acid.
Auric coming from aurum, the Latin word for

gold, which is why gold's symbol on the periodic
table is Au.

It's really sad to watch that gold dissolve away.

I wish there was a way for us to just make
other things into gold.

Now I know what you're thinking.
"Michael, that's alchemy."

But alchemy is quite real.
In today's particle accelerators we can smash

particles together, creating elements.
At the accelerator collider at GSI they can

create gold by smashing particles together
at a rate of 2 million gold atoms every second.

That's pretty cool, right?
Well, as you know, atoms are incredibly small.

They're so small that even though GSI can
make 2 million new gold atoms every single

second, were they to leave the machine on
at that rate for 50 million years they would

only produce 1 gram of gold.
Gold is rare and precious and expensive.

But gold is 40% more common than iridium.
And iridium is incredibly resilient.

It doesn't dissolve in aqua regia and it's
not even attacked by molten metals or silicates

at high temperature, which is nice and ..., but
not as pretty as cerium, which reacts at high

temperature to form beautiful little sparkles.
As we continue our journey to discover the

rarest thing to make a ring out of, we've
got to discuss osmium.

This stuff is so rare there's fewer than one
part per billion in our Earth's crust.

But we're not done yet.
Iridium and osmium are both in the platinum

family.
And if you take a look at platinum, it's much

more common than both iridium and osmium,
but there's something neat that I think we

should consider.
Stable isotopes.

And it's one of the isotopes of platinum that
will finish our story.

Platinum-190.
It's a stable isotope with half-life of over

billion years that's non-reactive.
It's fits all our criteria.

A ring made of the scarcest, naturally
occurring stable, non-reactive thing.

So hey, it would be an awesome ring.
Now, you're probably wondering, "Michael,

why did you experiment with vanadium, sulphur,
gold and cerium?"

Well, here's what's interesting.
Take a look at the periodic table and there's

symbols.
Ta-da!

Vsauce.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
