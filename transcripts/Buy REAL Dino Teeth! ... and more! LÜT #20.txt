An R2-D2 pepper mill and cologne that makes you smell

like Play-doh.
It's episode 20 of LÃœT.

This wallet

looks like a lot of hundreds and these
bars of soap from ThinkGeek

contain caffeine, really. Each shower you
take delivers the same

as a cuppa coffee, because caffeine can
be absorbed through your skin.

Soup up your phone's camera with
wide-angle telephoto and fish eye lenses

all in one contraption and then charge
your phone via USB

by installing sockets with USB ports.
Protect it with a heat-sensitive

backing that responds to your touch, like that little touch you add to your outfit by wearing

a tie that says joystick,

pong, Guitar Hero, Tetris or Duck hunt.

Your kids can stamp animal footprints
with these sandals. And this stamp

allows you to print over 2,000
different Japanese emoticons.

Also on Japan Trend Shop, a home planetarium

that project ten thousand of the stars and
galaxies seen in the northern hemisphere

onto your wall. These holiday cards for web
developers are stamped with the recipe

for eggnog

in Python, JavaScript, Relieve and PHP.
Pour some beer out of a skull pitcher

and make important life decisions with
this magic 8 ball

pen.
Then relax on your space invader couch or

sit on the toilet next to your dragon
toilet paper tyrant

and rest your head on the pillow that
makes you look like you're on the cover

of a magazine.
Do you like jewelry and engineering?

Well, grab yourself a gear-ring and how about this LED

faucet that tells the temperature of water
without getting you wet.

Blue is cold, green is warm and red is hot.

Hot like this heart necklace.
It's anatomically correct.

Cool down some ice cream scooped into
stackable cylinders

and decorate your body things to Etsy
user project Pinup,

who makes diablo health and mana
potion earrings,

but that's not all. She also makes
amazingly creepy cameos.

Remember the brain I used in the deja
vu episode? I bought it

from Evolution, a store in Manhattan that also
has an online store,

where you can buy actual dinosaur teeth,
actual pieces of meteorites

and more.
Today's free thing is more of a DONG -

Gapminder - a really cool site that allows
you to chart global data,

like life expectancy versus income
per person by country

and even play it through time to see how
things have changed.

More videos coming soon,
especially about outer space.

Why? Because I'm here at Space Camp with
Brad and Liam

from World of the Orange. We're shooting stuff
for YouTube.com/SpaceLab. The

only cool thing I've seen so far is this

pin they gave me right there.
Just

kidding. It's gonna be awesome.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
