could want kicks to the face kicks to

the nuts and heads up your butt you get

to pick you can raise your baby as a

geek asaurus or as a jock but if you

want to be really direct just make it a

football of course football can be geeky

even though it's one of the manliest

sports in the world especially when you

do this next to this gap which at least

is a better accident than the light on

this girl's knee which looks like um

here's a lion not a detroit lion but an

upside-down mouse awesome costumes are

awesome but when your team loses you're

sad but still in a funny costume but how
