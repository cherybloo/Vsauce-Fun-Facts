hey B saucers how you doing Michael here

first things first did you see the story

about Xbox Banning a guy for having

offensive language in his profile only

to learn later that he actually did live

in Fort Gay West Virginia well you can

read more about it in the description

the whole thing is resolved now but the

guy must feel so lucky that he didn't

also live on curly Dick road all right

let's get down to business the entire

point of this video is that I wanted to

share my five favorite video game WTF

dances obviously when it comes to WTF

dancing naked Sim orgis have everyone

beat but that doesn't mean that there

can't be other contenders so let's go

ahead and start with number five Moon

walking in Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2

number four dancing in Little Big Planet

look look at those guys

they're

um okay sorry that's just humping next

Infamous has been a treasure Trove of

awesome glitches but my favorite is this

girl look at her look at her which

reminds me of a video I saw of a

character who's created for Minecraft

he's got some nice moves but it looks

like he's having the same kind of

seizure that that girl was having in

fact if this is the kind of dancing you

like I heard the easiest way to do it is

just get your head stuck in a tree let's

move on to something classy something

cultured and refined how about Mass

Effect to

[Music]

ballet and if ballet is not your style

maybe butt dancing is here's Laura Coss

to show us yep okay mhm number one okay

this is my favorite because it's not

really a glitch it's very effortful and

it takes some skill it's dancing in Halo

all right so that's my list let me know

below if there's any other type of WTF

you'd like me to cover next maybe maybe

it's just mods I'm having a lot of fun

with those right now but anyway thank

you guys for listening and stay tuned

tomorrow for a super awesome nerd Wars

I'm looking forward to it okay bye-bye
