hey Vsauce Michael here if you have a

watch or a clock nearby take a look at

it's our hand

it moves completing a trip all the way

around twice a day its motion is too

slow to see but try really look at right

now watch how far it travels in one

second okay

one Mississippi done that's it

see how far it moved well if this watch

was the Milky Way that would be about

how far we have traveled in our solar

system around our galaxy since the

invention of writing since the beginning

not of time but of our history it's a

very small distance unnoticeable for

most of humanity's existence

there hasn't been writing physical

recordings of events or ideas today of

course we have writing and we have many

different ways to physically store data

we even now have digital ones but before

writing was invented all humans had was

biological storage memories there was no

eiga pedia no phone book no library but

what there was was old people

of everyone around they've experienced

the most heard the most things had the

most thoughts even today with all this

stuff around the oldest among us remain

the libraries of things that physical

and digital libraries either don't

haven't been or can't yet Chronicle

Aeschylus famously said that memory is

the mother of wisdom but like all

storage formats individuals don't last

forever

these can be lost we can die these can

obsolesce they can still be around but

have no way to be played back or read

they can be abandoned ignored these can

also just wear out just as we can forget

or develop dementia dementia involves a

decline in cognitive skills used to

perform everyday activities 60 to 80

percent of dementia cases are

Alzheimer's the disease is associated

with the accumulation of plaques and

tangles in the brain changes accompanied

by damage to brain cells and their death

the older a person is the more likely

they are to have developed Alzheimer's

but Alzheimer's is not a part of normal

aging symptoms of Alzheimer's disease

include a decrease in the ability to

think and remember confusion about time

and place new difficulties speaking and

writing changes in mood and personality

as we fight against other diseases and

live longer lives Alzheimer's looms on

the horizon as if waiting for us to pass

the test of other challenges as a cause

of death from 2000 to 2013 many things

decreased but Alzheimer's has grown

stopping it preventing it postponing its

development in our brains long enough

that we at least die of something else

with our memories is a real goal we can

achieve your brain fits inside this

thing your skull specifically this part

back here called the brain case or the

arrow cranium it's a bone fortress

protecting an inner sanctuary called the

cranial cavity your brain sits right

here except it doesn't really sit so

much as it swims you see the brain is

incredibly fragile soft and gooey model

or toy brains tend to be made out of

rigid plastic and actual specimens used

in dissection tend to be a rubbery

because they've been affected by

chemicals like formaldehyde but real raw

fresh brains right out of someone's

brain case are soft like soft tofu

holding one like this for too long will

leave a lasting and shaped depression

for that reason the brain has to float

so it doesn't crush itself under its own

weight but it doesn't float in water

instead it floats in a special liquid

your body makes called

cerebrospinal fluid now this isn't a

whole brain this is just the cerebrum

the largest part of the brain it plays a

key role in language thought abstract

thinking awareness consciousness it

thinks it's a pretty big deal literally

it's the part of you that does speaking

anyway the outside of the cerebrum is

called the cortex cortex means bark like

tree bark or a ride or a husk if I tear

off one of the temporal lobes we can

take a closer look at this rind it's

painted in maroon here you can see its

extent it's only about two to four

millimeters thick it's often called grey

matter because it appears pinkish

yellowish gray in a real brain beneath

it is the white matter white because

although grey matter contains a lot of

cell bodies the white matter contains

mainly axons that are myelinated that

send messages from grey matter to gray

matter locations myelin is a whitish

material that insulates electric

messages allowing them to move faster

and fast they do move signals travel

through axons at up to 432 kilometers

per hour

that's 275 miles per hour about the top

speed of the fastest production car in

the world you can say this car literally

travels at the speed of thought but

that's slow compared to the speed of

electricity through a conductor which is

closer to 50 to 99% the speed of light

anyway

the brain is very wrinkly and that's

because a wrinkled shape allows more

cerebral cortex to fit into a smaller

container if we could take this entire

line all of your cerebral cortex flatten

it out it would be well about like this

it would be about 2 to 4 millimeters

thick and have an area equivalent to a

square 50 centimeters by 50 centimeters

about 20 by 20 inches obviously you

can't fit this shape into this shape

unless you crumple it up and now we're

getting somewhere

when we crumple the brain up we get

folds the folds are called gyri Cingular

gyrus and the crevices are called sulci

singular sulcus about two thirds of your

cerebral cortex is buried deep within

sulci out of view as for memories well

every time you learn something new or

memorize something new your brain

doesn't gain another wrinkle or anything

like that instead memories appear to be

more about connections relationships and

patterns formed by connected neurons

when neurons fire together again and

again rehearse their connections and

bonds become stronger they become more

likely to fire together again to be

recalled roughly that might be how

memory works and it's a helpful way to

think about some interesting phenomena

like the fact that it's quite difficult

to list off the name of every book

you've ever read that's like really

difficult but if someone were to just

name book titles you could effortlessly

tell them whether or not you read the

book hearing the title likely excites

neuron connections more directly

involved with the connections associated

with your memory of having read that

title

than a mere prompt to name some books

you've read when brain cells and their

connections are damaged blocked

compromised or killed memories conveyed

and the formation of new memories can be

hampered learning how this happens in

Alzheimer's isn't just important for

those diagnosed but also for all of us

interested in memory in one to five

percent of Alzheimer's cases genetic

differences can be identified but the

cause of most cases is still mostly

unknown a number of hypotheses and

observations exist for example we know

that 15% of individuals with Down

syndrome who live 40 years or longer

develop Alzheimer's disease and 50 to 70

percent of those who live to 60 do down

syndrome is caused by the presence of

all or part of a third copy of

chromosome 21 we still have a lot to

learn but chromosome 21 is also involved

in the plaques found in the brains of

people with Alzheimer's within this

chromosome are the genetic instructions

for the production of a protein called

amyloid precursor protein or AP P a P P

seems to play a role in neural growth

and repair it's found on cells

throughout the entire body it's

processed by the body in different ways

most often an enzyme called alpha secret

tastes Cleaves it into SA P P alpha and

C 83 less often an enzyme called beta

secret ace snips a P P a bit higher up

releasing a smaller fragment called

s a P P beta a third enzyme can

gamma-secretase and cleave AIC DOA

leaving p3 if alpha secret tastes active

first and beta-amyloid if beta secret

tastes acted first the normal function

of beta amyloid isn't exactly known yet

it may play an important role in healthy

brain function but if too much is made

or maybe if too little is cleared away

too slowly or if the protein folds in

the wrong ways fragments can stick

together creating oligomers groups of a

few pieces say four or five these

oligomers can then stick to other

oligomers and become larger structures

called plaques the effect oligomers and

plaques have on brain cells and brain

health is being studied oligomers may be

more toxic they may allow unregulated

ion flow into neurons causing their

deaths what we do know is that

Alzheimer's disease is associated with

these plaques in the brain as well as

another protein related anomaly tangles

a protein called tau stabilizes

microtubules in brain cells like

railroad ties holding tracks together

the tracks that guide nutrients and

other molecules throughout the cell in

many neurodegenerative diseases tau

proteins become abnormally sticky and

tangled with other tau proteins

compromising the delivery network we do

know some factors associated with

increased or decreased risk but their

exact relationships with cognitive

decline aren't all certain things

associated with a reduced risk for

Alzheimer's disease include physical

activity a heart-healthy diet learning a

second language later in life being

social frequently interacting with

people protecting your head and

intellectual activities like crossword

puzzles playing instruments reading

board games education such activities

may improve overall brain health and

cognitive skills

with a brain more resilient to damage

should it come whatever the case there's

a lot more we can learn it is incredible

and exciting and a little scary to

realize how much more we have to learn

about the brain we know more about the

orbital mechanics of distant binary

stars than we do about the very

mechanisms we use to know about them in

the first place

inner space is as mysterious and deep as

outer space and of course between the

two one doesn't even care if we exist

while the other well the other is us the

wobbly gel in our heads

no stiffer than a good booger is fragile

and still very much of a scientific

frontier

it looks like soft meat but it can not

only think reason feel remember and lie

it can also care for other people and

the goopy wrinkled things inside their

skulls it can be patient with them see

them as people no matter how they change

whether by growing up

or growing way up supporting research

caregivers and those diagnosed is

something we can all do so thank you and

as always thanks for watching

now the sword that will defeat

Alzheimer's is probably made of gold
