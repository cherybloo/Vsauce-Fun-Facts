Vsauce. Michael here today with a
special video.

It's a Skype conversation I had with Newt
from Underbelly where he teaches me

about six actual villains from real
comic books

that are really, really lame. He's joined
by a bunch of ladies from Underbelly,

and as you will see immediately from
Storytime, he's quite

the ladies man.
First things first, you should know that

I'm kinda busy right now playing the
May update for Angry Birds Rio

and I'm not wearing pants.
So,

we're already up to a really good start.
"Hey, over here.

It can't be," Prince Hobopopo says.
"In the flesh."

If you're gonna read me the bad guys, you
gotta read in the scary voice. You know I

only want you on the show if you do what
I tell you. "In the flesh."

Just be quiet, I wanna do this.
At number 6

we were gonna have Kite-Man, who's a Batman
villain, who's just some

dork with a kite strapped to his back,
but I decided instead

to go with a color-blind villain, because
color blindness is nothing to joke about

in America.

So, I thought I would go with Rainbow
Rider, who is a flash

villain and this guy just sucks, alright?
He basically

has glasses that project colours and
then he create structures for him to

emote from that are colourful, but I mean,
really, this guy's just fabulous. 'Cause

everything

is rainbow colored. Anyway, it's just one of those
characters where it's like four o'clock in

the morning and they're like "oh, we got to
have the Flash fight, somebody."

"I know, we'll have a guy who rides rainbows."
The

next one on the list, number 5,
we have armless

Tiger Man. Basically this guy's story was
he was a small German boy who had his

arms ripped off

in an industrial accident. He went around
during Golden Age Marvel books

using his sharp teeth and his prowess with his toes

to destroy all machines.
Next up on the list we have Crazy

Quilt, who is a Batman villain and this
guy has the most

eye-be-jarringly bad costume in comic book history.

And I think I just made up the word "eye-be-jarring." Crazy Quilt was a low-level

robber who was blinded by a bullet,

but in prison had an experimental
surgery to restore his vision,

but unfortunately the vision that he was
left with was so disorienting

that it drove him crazy. Wow, Vsauce doesn't even have t-shirts and you guys already have

dresses and girls.
We have several... we have home and away uniforms.

Next up on the list we have Egg Fu.

An Egg Fu was a Wonder Woman villain,
who, at the peak of the Red Scare,

would try to have people denounce their
love for the red white and blue

and this worked with him using fear,
because he is essentially a giant

egg with a mustache.
Katie, what do you think about Egg Fu?

It doesn't matter, she's a woman.
Next up from the

freaky deaky seventies,
we have the Hypno-Hustler.

And this guy's clearly... he's got the most glorious

glittering crusted Afro I've seen
on the printed page, it's amazing.

Armed with hypno goggles and...
Oh, one second. Thank you.

Any port in a storm, right?

The ladies keep coming. I have them bring
me drinks every now and again when

I get parched.

Armed with his hypno goggles

and power boots, he put the audience in a trance

and was able to rob them.
His name is

Turner D. Century and he was a Spider Woman

villain and essentially he, he hates
young people

and he wants to restore, restore
San Francisco to the glory days

of like the 1900's.
So he flies around

on a bicycle, okay?
And he goes

toe-to-dandy-toe with any superhero
who tries to stop him.

And he has a horn that's honking fury
will kill anyone under the age of 65

years old.

And that's how he can restore San
Francisco to the glory days.

So that was our top six worst,
my top six super villains

in comic book history. And this is
kicking off, this month is Superhero Month.

We're gonna give you a top 10 worst
superhero list,

so turn up a little bit. Kevin
from Underbelly is going to give us a

little

piece called "Saving Superman."
And then we're gonna introduce a new

Underbelly character and we hope that you
enjoy it. It's gonna be some fantastic stuff

going on this weekend,

just in time for Captain America and the
Green Lantern, all the big

comic book movies coming out this summer.
That is perfect. So yeah, everybody out

there

go over to Underbelly show on YouTube and
be sure you're subscribed

for their unique brand of infotainment,
and, of course, the ladies. In fact, to fit in

better, let me just do this.

Perfect, okay, great.
So,

yeah, go check it out, it's super hero and villain

month over on Underbelly shows.
