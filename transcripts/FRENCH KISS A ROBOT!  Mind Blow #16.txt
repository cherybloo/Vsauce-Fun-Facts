The N64 upside down looks like a koala's face.

And here's a wall that changes color
when you pee on it.

Vsauce. Kevin here.
This is Mind Blow.

This jet pack of sorts just set a
record by flying for seven straight

minutes.

The company claims their current model
can carry a 250-pound man for half an

hour

at a max speed of 60 miles per hour.
But if you prefer to sit down while you

travel, try out his motorized

easy chair.
It's just a prototype, so you can't buy it.

Or this monster.
It's a 1000 watt subwoofer chair

with two 16-inch subwoofers and it can
connect the iPods

or gaming consoles.
Apparently some people like to sit on recycled

computer parts

with Ethernet and ribbon woven seats encased frame.

And others like to sit on... wow.
The flexible

love seat incorporates an accordion
like honeycomb structure

made from recycled paper and wood.
It's kind of like a slinky for your

butt.
Get ready for summer with the Nerf

Thunderstorm. It's a battery-powered
super soakers, so you don't need to pump it

and it has interchangeable clips of water.

You could stay inside all summer
and just build a giant Lego wall.

You'll need 270,000 legos

and probably a bodyguard with a Lego ARC gun from

District 9.
Or stay inside for thirty years and build

a toothpick sculpture of San Francisco.
There are

eight paths for ping pong balls to
travel along as they tore this incredibly

intricate creation.
Quick challenge.

Listen to this music box and see if you
recognize the song.

Time's up.

Here's the mega answer.

This is a prototype of a screen that
follows your

eye movements. By using a webcam with face
tracking software,

the idea is to make games like
first-person shooters seem even more

immersive.
And to make kissing less immersive,

here's a kissing transmission device.
Basically you make out with his strong

looking thing

and it transmits the data to affect the
other straw looking

thing and...
Guy getting struck by lightning.

A Russian figure skating couple won
a silver medal

thanks to their plumber-themed routine.

Finally here's an absolutely epic record-setting

Beatmania performance.

I'm gonna leave you with a riddle.

"Only one color but not one size

Stuck at the bottom yet easily flies

Present in sun but not in rain

Doing no harm and feeling no pain

What is it?"

The genius of the week is going to be a number

scavenger hunt.

Here's how it works.
I've given 5 clues,

each clue leads to a number.
Three clues are on this page.

One clue is at Facebook.com/VsauceGaming.

And the final clue is in 'Weirdos of the
Month #2.'

Find all five clues, add up all the
numbers and give us your answer.

Leave it in the comments below and I'll
give you a hint for the clue in 'Weirdoes #2.'

Eurovision.
Good luck.

And as always, thanks for watching.

Vsauce.

Announcement time. First things first, we've
got a brand new video on Vsauce2

that's a little bit different.
It's a conversation with myself in a group

called

'Underbelly' where they share with me some creepy

Pokemon facts.
They're really knowledgeable, I think you'll enjoy it.

Speaking of you, it's about time you got rewarded

more. And so, over the next few months,
Vsauce is going to be expanding genius of

the week

to include more slots.
On our channel page right now we've got two.

One is the Genius of the Week that Kevin already
mentioned, but the second one is a brand

new title called

'Sauciest of the Week.'
This is for someone who suggested something really

cool to Vsauce.

Whether it was a private message or on
Facebook, whether it was an online game or

a cool

image or something to buy, or just a hilarious comment.

Now, for the first week I chose 'sofusser,'

because of all the cool things he made with
stuff that we recommended on DONG.

But here's the excellent part.
Each week the current winner

picks next week's winner. So, 'sofusser,' if you're out there watching and you see

something over the next week that was
suggested to us or someone put something

on Facebook you think is cool,

let us know. Send us a YouTube message and
let us know who you think should be the

next week's winner.

And then that winner will pick the week after
that. So every winner gets to pass

the crown.
It should be pretty fun to see what happens.

And, hey guys,

as always,

thanks for watching.
