it's a nerd force oh good what style

we're doing it now alright so welcome to

nerds war there's a very special nerds

war we didn't prep because I slice my

finger [ __ ]

oh um so we're doing a nerds war extreme

Adam vs. Jeff said I'm playing Adam and

I will be arguing in favor of Jeff

exactly here it goes let's do it

in this corner atom mcLaughlin you know

why Adam would win this fight

why's that because he just walk around

being labeled a solo boring burn

bouncing people off with his intense

fatness job on wookie exactly you know

you'd think that would make a difference

but before Adam could pounce and bump

you with his gut the blinding light off

of Jeff's forehead would blind Adam

hunts leaving him open for a second

attack really but you noisy but Jeff

wouldn't even see Adam coming because

Adams in disguise I don't know if you

know this Adam has a superpower but just

blends in with homeless people you just

be walking down the street Nelson yeah

that's true I've done that and they'd be

like but you think sir can have a

cigarette but you see right there as

soon as Adam jumped out and was about to

attack Jeff would interrupt him in the

middle of his thought oh that's true he

does have quite Thea and divert him into

a whole different subject about gay sex

speaking of gay sex but you've forgotten

Adams secret ability Buber gayness he

would just bend over and insert Jeff

stick right into his ass ha ha ha ha but

before he could do it Jeff would

interrupt by placing his finger inside

Adam's rectum that's true Jeff does love

to stick his finger in things it smells

like victory for Jeff and I think I

think Jeff won

no no all right we did
