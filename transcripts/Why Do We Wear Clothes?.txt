Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

Why do humans wear clothing?

Sure, we need it for protection from the
elements and fashion,

to show our personalities,

but no other animal makes and wears clothing.

More importantly, why do we feel embarrassed
to be naked around other people?

The word "embarrassed" comes from 

the Portuguese route,

"embara√ßa", which means to entangle or entwine.

And feeling embarrassed often
feels like being tied up or exposed.

But how can a healthy

amount of embarrassment be a sign

that you are likeable,

forgivable

and trustworthy.

This t-shirt and hoodie

come from the YouTube Space LA,

which opened in November of 2012.

But clothing

has been around a lot longer than that,

for at least

the last 100,000 years.

Clothing protects us from the cold,

from rain, from the Sun

and it can also be an ornament.

A way of accentuating certain parts
of our bodies or showing off wealth,

status.

It can even help us build

our own identities. But today I'm
interested in another use of clothing,

modesty.

Why are humans

afraid to be naked?

Why are we ashamed of nudity?

Especially because animals pretty much
walk around naked

all the time.

Why aren't animals embarrassed to be naked?

Well...

Let's take a closer look at embarrassment.

Embarrassment is a fascinating emotion and

an extremely social one.

You don't ever really ever feel embarrassed
alone, when no one's watching you or

listening to you.
So,

embarrassment probably evolved because
it is such a good influence on social

cooperation.

We feel embarrassed when we violate little

social rules of conduct and each of us
individually hoping to avoid that,

to avoid embarrassment, 
has helped all of us live together better.

Healthy brains experience embarrassment.

Neurodegeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes

can lead to less

awareness of yourself.

So a healthy amount of occasional embarrassment

is a good thing.

It's a sign of a socially adept

and normally functioning brain.

A famous experiment involved participants

watching an actor

receive

praise for achieving a very very high score

on an exam.

In some cases

the actor was told to feign pride in the achievement.
And in others,

they acted

embarrassed to have attention put on themselves.

Later,

the actors and the participants played games together

and the participants were more pro-social,

friendly and cooperative

with actors who earlier expressed embarrassment.

It's suggested that the actor was to be
trusted, that they desired to

fit in and work together.

Now, the fact that embarrassment displays
our knowledge of others and our desire

to be liked

may explain why evoking embarrassment
in others, whether it be flirtation or

playful teasing, is so common

when we kind of like the other person.

Shame is a stronger emotion.
And shame, when it comes to

our private parts, the kind nearly every
society - western or not - shares to some

degree is related to the root of our question today,

modesty.

Havelock Ellis' writing on the
evolution of modesty

is a big antiquated when it comes to vocabulary,
but he discusses quite well

two possible reasons for our fear

of nakedness,

both of which predate clothing and
are not unique to humans.

The first

is the vital phenomenon of

refusal.

Before mating, many animals play a game of

chase,

hard to get,

a game of acceptance and then flight,

forcing the pursuer to

keep up

and prove their determination before being chosen

as a desirable mate.
So,

when it comes to humans, we can think of clothing,

paradoxically, as both a means of

drawing attention to one's body

and simultaneously

as a way to

cover the body

modestly,

making us less available to every
and any potential mate,

rendering

breeding more selective.

Ellis also mentions the fear of evoking disgust.
And it's easy to see why

individuals of a species, who avoid things
we consider disgusting, would survive better.

Fecal material, waste, rubbish, other
bodily secretions can spread disease.

For instance,

animals whose poop likely contains
dangerous parasites avoid grazing around

or hanging out around

their waste.

Habits like that lead to more sanitary conditions

and a species more likely

to survive. It's a satisfying piece of
evidence as to why clothing once

invented was so quickly used to cover

private areas.

In 2009, the BBC
investigated another influential factor - 

raising children.

In species where the young are born
pretty much ready for life,

it makes more sense to spend your time making babies,

as opposed to sitting around raising them.
They don't need it.

Super precocial animals, like the megapode,
hatch with full flight feathers

and can fly on their own within hours of hatching.

Human babies, on the other hand,
are pretty darn altricial. We are born

barely able to do much besides swallow
food put directly into our mouths.

Newborns can't walk or talk or
cook meals for themselves or drive

themselves to work.

It's ridiculous.

Why are human babies born so unready for life?

Why is so much development time still
needed after human kids are born?

Well, one explanation is that it's
because we are so brilliant.

Brain size is correlated with the body size.
Bigger bodies require bigger brains.

The shrew has a smaller brain than a human,
but us humans have smaller brains

than wales.
Of course, a bigger brain is not indicative of

intelligence.

For one thing, larger animals literally
just have more cells they need to worry

about

and control.

What matters more when it comes to
intelligence is the proportion

of brain size to body size.

Compared to the size of our bodies,

our brains are gigantic, they're outliers,

they're off the charts.

It's crazy. And a consequence of this is
that in order to to have a brain, as big

as ours,

come out of a mother, as small as

a human, we have to come out with brains
that aren't fully formed. Brains and heads

that aren't as big as they will eventually
grow to be. And this is why human

babies require so much care and so much
time to develop before their brains are

ready for them to go off

on their own.

Under this theory, being naked and
mating all of the time

might be a little bit less of a
priority for humans.

Humans and societies that privilege modesty

would have more time
and resources to put toward raising children

and avoiding extra mates,
instead of just conceiving

more kids,

allowing kids to develop properly and 
reproduce themselves.

Clothing serves this purpose quite well.

It conceals the privates and allows
more time to be spent on other

things.

Clothes,

clothing

may, in a way, actually be a consequence of our unique

intelligence.

So the next time you put on clothes,

keep in mind that one of the reasons
you're not running out into the world

butt-naked

is because you have

such a big brain.

No matter how dumb

the clothing is that you're putting on,

it's a reminder that we

are smart.

And as always,

thanks for watching.

Kevin, thank you for joining me.
Thanks for having me.

I hear

that there is an insect wing that can
naturally shred bacteria.

That's right. I talk all about that and other
mind-blowing things over on Vsauce2 in the

new episode of

of Mind Blow. Alright, well, let's go over there
and watch it. In fact, you guys can come

with us too.
