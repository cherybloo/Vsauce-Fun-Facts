hey Vsauce Michael here this is the song

of the kawaii

OOW bird in 1987 this species of bird

became extinct there are no more but

before the last living one died its song

was recorded this is that song it is the

song of an ending the final member of a

species asking to know one hey where are

we all it's a male calling for a mate

that will never come for what it's worth

the song is still here we are listening

to it now because it was recorded the

species is lost but the song isn't and

that's the heart of something really big

remember that the word record comes from

core meaning heart to record is to wreak

or to bring something back into your

heart echoes fossils bones footprints

nature's memory is only so immediate I

mean even light itself scatters is

absorbed and dense according to the

inverse-square law the universe forgets

slowly but we humans have created

special ways to preserve moments to take

them and turn them into stories things

that can be shared we recorded retold

disappear perhaps much later than they

would otherwise

I recently had the opportunity to speak

with Sir David Attenborough the mind and

voice behind so many important stories

and Natural History programs like the

very new planet Earth - from BBC earth I

even got to see an episode and of course

it's phenomenal it's also a time capsule

of sorts a gift that perhaps humans

alone on this planet can give earth a

record of itself I'd like to share our

conversation with you we covered many

things technology science communication

humans life language but let's start

with one of the most immediate effects

the program has on viewers it's a mirror

in nature in animals we see ourselves

despair love hope heroes and villains

now whether the animals themselves are

aware of these emotions or themes is

difficult to know or even investigate

but I asked Sir David Attenborough about

storytelling and the responsibilities

that come with that power this whole

program is like a night at the movies

but the characters are animals and there

haven't been scripted it makes me wonder

if you know all the things that pull at

our hearts that we write for the screen

for actors are just us replaying the

same dramas that have been around since

earth began well that's that's true life

has the same first life the emergence of

a new individual creature onto this

planet the end is in the an in-between

while those mating and there's

aggression and the so on and so these

are the eternal stories and you you

neglect or ignore their power actual

peril I mean these are the important

stories and you you do try to do them

justice them it both in fundamental

truths and profound truths and in the

trimmings

do you have advice for younger science

communicators when it comes to reaching

a large audience in acting the the

change that they want to see I don't

think I have any advice I'm still

learning and still struggling with

things and it's a very collaborative

jabu person who starts giving handing

out advice people know that know what

they're after

Barnard's if they're any good in the

business they know what they're after

and then they want to do and in any case

the advice I give it's bound to be about

yesterday's technology or yesterday's

way of doing things and tomorrow is what

we're on about and and it's it's young

people today who are using the new

technology in ways that I can't dream of

so I wouldn't give advice to people I

mean people talk about going to learn to

make documentary films and and I say

don't come to me ivan is yesterday's

equipment you've got to be using

tomorrow's equipment and you'll do it in

your and that equipment well if you're

true to it will dictate the way in which

you deal with it and what you handle

these things and that's the way you get

advanced is in whatever technology or

deed whatever art we're talking about

technology is a big part of planet Earth

- we can document record track and film

animals now like never before in the ten

years since the first planet Earth

drones have become smaller and quieter

we have learned how to better find and

study and predict animal behavior planet

Earth - captured things that we science

had not yet seen happen and in some

cases didn't even know did happen I just

was really struck today by the landmark

nature of the program that's why I think

it's so important I think that we're

documenting things that 50 years ago no

one even had seen and I think we have a

responsibility for better or worse to

document these things

for ourselves for others and for the

future I think we have a very fortunate

time living and very fortunate

technologies enable us to do things and

we ought to use it with some sense of

responsibility for the next generation

and it is absolutely the case that a

demonstrable species are disappearing

and it's quite possible the things that

I filmed 20 years ago in 30 years time

will not be exist so we have that as a

responsibility I mean what would we not

give to be able to see a but I Tanis or

our dinosaur hunting people had been

around that - the time scale is

different silly better to say mammoths

it would be great to see a mammoths

would it not or even a dodo bird I'd

like yeah I wouldn't mind seeing a dead

okay we have photographs of them were

just I thinking no no no no no yes we

don't even have a complete genuine

individual body really no the last

complete one was a specimen in Oxford

Museum and in the middle of the early

nineteenth century developed maggots and

so on so they burnt it but they've then

some chap pulled out one or two of the

bones but now you have you have you can

put together and enough bones from

different individuals to have a complete

dodo skeleton so you know who the shape

of every bone but then you don't have

the individual and even the ones you see

in museums no one nearly all was made of

sort of chicken feathers and suitably

dyed and painted with a plaster head the

camera can now capture things that

nature and ourselves previously

struggled to keep with such detail like

the dodo bird which went extinct in the

1600s it's easy to feel sad that such

creatures are lost that we can't pet

them today or that there wasn't a planet

Earth program back then to at least film

them but speaking of that emotion

feeling hope and pity at the

helplessness of an animal in the wild

being hunted as prey struggling to get

back on land to feed its children

like these chinstrap penguins should we

do more than record them I mean in cases

like this ought we intervene and give

them a helping hand when it comes to

interfering mm-hmm

where would you draw the line what if I

wanted to like help the chinstrap

penguins get onto the land

yeah is that a good way to interfere or

even then should I let them grow it

their own ways I mean if you if if you

see if you're filming a little Impala

for a little antelope form hiding in the

grass

freezing still refusing to move and

you'll see a cheetah it's talking it was

it and you've been filming this little

pond fawn because you've been its

relationship with its mother so you

weren't seeing it suckling and so on and

the temptation there you can see this

cheetah getting closer to lean out of

the land robe and say shoot you know and

know if you did that certainly the form

would run and would be actually

terrified out of its wits and run

probably so far I wouldn't be able to

find its way back the cheetah would have

lost its prey wouldn't been able to

catch up with it

and so the cheetah would go back and and

have to find another Impala for the

first Impala for will probably not get

back and we knocked off by something

else because it's away from its home

territory so what you've done is

actually make things worse I also asked

about humans where is the planet Earth

episode about people he said this your

own species is a different kettle of

fish

it's why you can't make a natural

history series about Homo sapiens that's

any good because I ran I once wrote one

I once started to write a series well

why don't we look at human beings just

as though they are animals we'll fill

them in the same way as you would film

monkeys or elephants or whatever

but then at the penny dropped you can't

make a series about any animal how human

or anything else unless you deal with

sexuality and courtship so suddenly you

find that you are actually a peeping tom

that you're going to you're gonna film

people in courtship without ten 'i'm

impossible you can do that with animals

yeah yes you do but that's the point you

can't do that for animals because we are

not animals and not animals in that

sense we are animals in other senses but

we can't do it to our own species in my

view right how are we different the

closer we look for differences

distinctions hard-and-fast discrete

separations the more blur we see we

aren't the only things that use tools

that play that communicate that have

social structure the differences we hope

to find often turn out to be issues not

of unprecedented features but of matters

of degree even language now appears not

to be a sudden invention or gift but

rather a property that emerged from a

happy accident of more primitive

features we happen to be in the right

place to inherit Sir David Attenborough

and I spoke about distinctions and words

when I asked about life what would you

say defines life and defines defined

humors yeah life what is the difference

between the particles their living and

dead yeah

don't know because you can't simply say

it's it's it's reproduction because the

little bubbles reproduce you know it's

funny that that line is so hard to

define when we spend our whole lives

alive yeah and that's why when you're

dealing with it with questions about

well how did life start you say well I

can't tell you how excited exactly but I

can tell you where it starts and all the

sorts of things that that began and they

were things like complex molecules which

we've got a membrane around the

and eventually before you knew where

they were they were policies but when

that magic moment comes that extraordin

my we still don't understand I like that

I hadn't really thought of this before

but yeah dead and alive or concepts we

came up with I once tried to ask someone

who was an expert is a hyena a cat or a

dog and he just refused to answer he

said we make up these categories

absolutely right I mean we have this

passion to classify and that's the basic

answer because the only way you can hunt

handle very very complex something's you

have to start pacify in order to be able

to get into a handle of all bits but

that's a human concept that's what we've

done we have to decide that that that's

a captain that's a dog because those are

the two things that we started off with

but then as you explore the world you

would discover that there are things

that are neither harder and you can then

eventually if you're clever enough and

lucky enough to find the specimens you

can form a phylogenetic tree and you can

see in the spread then the time when at

the base of roof there's a thing that

which is that what you might call a cog

or a bag or a cat or whatever I mean

which is neither one or the other that's

the way it is and then they've out

diversified and then slowly became

things but but it's a it's a human

construct what do you want people to

take away from planet Earth - as opposed

to planet Earth one or other programs

you've worked on the reality and the

importance of the world the recognition

that we aren't the only species that

inhabited the recognition that in moral

terms we can't assume that everything is

ours for to do with exactly how we wish

and that other creatures on the earth

also have places in the in the grand

scheme of things

and then actually we are part of that

and then if we damage them in the end

read Amager selves why is it important

for us to record and document to give

ourselves the perspective of ourselves

on our own futures and iron past our

planet is amazing nature preserves

itself as best it can but the hill it

rolls down natural selection isn't about

preserving the past it's about survival

we however can tell stories about things

describe them record them measure them

with more detail and voice than any

other living or nonliving thing even if

a story is just made up it's still an

attempt to articulate encapsulate and

preserve something a thought and idea

that otherwise would be forgotten I

don't know if this ability makes humans

different from other animals but it does

in a way mean that we are our planet's

autobiographer 'he's the part of it that

documents and records and tells about it

so let's tell as many stories as

possible and as always thanks for

watching
