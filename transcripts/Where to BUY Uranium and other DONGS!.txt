Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And over the weekend I was in Los Angeles,

where I got to meet up with Henry,
the creator of MinutePhysics.

But let's get to some DONGS.
MinutePhysics recommended

Grow Cube. You win by selecting the
elements in the correct

order. I was kinda like big deal,
but then MinutePhysics pointed out

that understanding the subtle relationships
between the way the animations happen

and way the items interact is something
that the human brain is

awesome at, but computers not so much.
These's are one of the few types of games

where people can be computers. So go play
one, and after you beat it, look at the

screen and go

"take that computer."
SnipeZzLeGacY recommended Continuity,

a really clever game where you have to
rearrange the puzzle pieces

of the game to make it playable. And 'No
One Mourns the Nolan' recommended Blow

Six,

where you shoot balls at bricks to knock them
off, but using larger and larger balls

costs you points,

so be careful.
NothinbatHD sent me "Kill Me."

New versions of yourself appear
over and over again

and the bodies of your former selves can
be strategic safe zones.

DeluxeFreeman sent me the best type of koala,

the kind you have to laboriously wave
your cursor over and over and over

to divide into small enough pixels to
be intelligible.

KryptiCxLeGenD threw me a curveball

3D pong.
And oh look, a complete breakdown of

10 codes. 10-4 means OK, but there are 98 others.

Htwins.net contains some of my favorite WebWork.

These are the guys behind the amazing scale
of the universe tool I've covered before,

but they also have spatial intelligence
games like

rolling a cube, so that a certain
face faces down at the right time.

I also like this one where the guy can't
walk and you have to pre-plan

his automatic route. Joe Sabia is one of
the most creative people I know. His

internet works

are super clever. I specially like how he
made this interactive game

on Facebook.

Bob Lazar was a guy who purportedly
worked at Area 51.

What does he do now?
Well, he runs UnitedNuclear.com,

a website where you can actually buy
small,

legal quantities of radioactive
isotopes/

Finally @GothisLifeStyle @tweetsauce-d
a fantastic list of cool

mind hacks, like the Pinnochio effect or
the fact that you can not rotate one of

your feet clockwise

while simultaneously drawing the number
six in the air

without having to reverse your foot.
Pretty weird, right?

And as always,

thanks for watching.
