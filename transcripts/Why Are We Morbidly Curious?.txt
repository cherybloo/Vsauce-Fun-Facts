Hey Vsauce. Michael here. In 1924

psychologist Carney Landis drew lines on people's faces

and then photographed them in various
scenarios

to study facial expressions.

But he didn't use actors

and he didn't tell the participants to
pretend to feel emotions. Instead,

he subjected them to actual trauma.

He had them do things like

smell ammonia, look at pornographic images and even reach their hand in

buckets of wet slimy frogs.

His most intense directive

involved ordering them to take a knife and while being photographed

cut off the head of a living rat.

Seriously.

Most initially refused to cut the head off,
but eventually

two-thirds agreed to do as they were told,

including a 13-year-old boy referred to
the psychology department by a doctor

for high blood pressure thought to be
caused by emotional instability.

Many believe his inclusion in Landis' experiment

was an accident.

If replicated today Landis might be arrested

but what is psychologically arresting
about these images

is that the unease and disgust and fear they show

is real.

It's disturbing

but fascinating.

We are paradoxically drawn towards some
pretty repulsive things:

car accidents, car chases,

the possibility of a crash or a fight,

or a natural disaster; I mean not one that hurts anyone, of course,

but one that's exciting.

Celebrity scandal,

drama, disfiguration, true crime, war

and gore, the macarbe. Like the Kangling, a trumpet

used during Himalayan Buddhist rituals
that's made out of a human leg bone.

We often feel guilty for being interested

in these types of things, after all, they are unpleasant

but yet we can't look away. Why?

Well, there is no single reason, there are
many of them

but they can be mould into a mnemonic.

We like disturbing things because we like

to scream.

They give us strength, catharsis

reality, exploration, acceptance and meaning.

Watching someone eat gross tasting jellybeans

or a ghost pepper or a spoonful of cinnamon or

suffer in more extreme ways, is a kinda
strange thing to like to do

but it's part of what keeps us alive.

We are curious, even if the outcome

could be bad.

We often find uncertainty more
unpleasant

than unpleasant certainty. At least if we look

we know.

There's a neurological basis for
exploring in the face of danger.

We become more attentive and alert

when we are frightened, which makes
sense.

Neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine

are released when we are scared

physically and mentally preparing us to

take on a threat or successfully escape from it.

Dopamine is famously part of the brains

reward system.

Dopamine is released in response to pleasurable

things, like sex and food, but that doesn't mean

our brains find disturbing things
pleasurable.

It's more interesting than that.

When dopamine systems

are inhibited in laboratory animals, they will cease

to seek out food

and literally starve to death; because
they no longer find food

fun?

No.

If food is placed

in their mouths, they will consume it and express

signs of satisfaction.

Evidence like this suggests that the brain contains

systems that motivate seeking, approaching and curiosity

for their own sake.

This has implications in the study of

compulsive behaviour.

Just because you want to do something

doesn't mean you like it.

The rush of chemicals into our brains and bodies when we are

scared

help us. When the threats are real. But if the threats

aren't real, or if we are safely distant from them,

and merely spectating, the same chemicals still

appear, making us more attentive, more curious

and making it more difficult to look away.

In the early nineteen hundreds

Eug√®ne-Louis Doyen published incredible
images of corpses he cut

into stackable slices. The images

are amazingly macarbe but yet utterly

fascinating and a wonderful reminder of what we are

literally made of.

We often feel like we need an excuse,

like Halloween or anatomy homework, in
order to look at things like that

without coming across as a total weirdo. I mean

come on if you look too interested in
the macarbe it might look like you are

into, approve of or enjoy the gruesome.

Funny enough, that guilt may very well fuel

our desire to look in the first place. Sometimes

pressure to not do something can
actually make people more likely

to do that thing.

It's called The Boomerang Effect.

There are many different ways for things to

boomerang: one is The Streisand Effect,

when trying to suppress something unintentionally

makes it more widely distributed. In 2003

Barbra Streisand sued to suppress a photo

published online, as part of a
California Coastline Preservation Project.

One of the photos, the one she was trying to get rid of, showed

her house.

Within a month of the lawsuit going public

nearly half a million people had flooded
the website and downloaded the

picture. Before the suit only six people

had downloaded the image, two of which were her lawyers.

In a similar fashion, social pressures
and tabboos against viewing

disturbing things can make them more

interesting,

rarer and so a more valuable commodity, and also

free, in that deliberately viewing them can demonstrate to ourselves and others

that we are free and can do what we want.

Disturbing things can also make us feel

stronger, because their repulsiveness

is a challenge.

Glenn Sparks at Purdue University

has studied the way terrifying films affect us.

After watching them, viewers often feel stronger,

satisfied that they didn't chicken out, that they made it through,

they conquered something disturbing and were able to handle it.

It's almost a form of practice. As Stephen
King put it,

"We make up horrors to help us cope with the real ones".

On the more negative side, following
celebrity scandals or seeing

defeat on the faces of the rival team

can make you feel pretty good. It's
called

'Schadenfreude', which means harm joy; getting pleasure

from others misfortunes. Social comparison theory

describes and predicts behavior like this
although grades and

rankings cause anxiety, we nonetheless
possess

a drive to seek out evaluations of ourselves

in comparison to others, we especially
enjoyed the evaluations

that put us on top.

Now, causing other people to be

less well off sort of makes sense under this lens.

If its relative happiness you're
concerned with, trolling or harassing or griefing

other people sort of works, it doesn't make

you happier but compared to the people
you're annoying,

you are less annoyed.

So...

yay?

Viewing scenes of

anger and vengeance and violence

that don't even involve us can nonetheless cause

our own anger and aggression to burn off, as though they're being

satisfied. It's called catharsis,

a cleanser, a purification. Creating images and movies
and stories that play with our

emotions might be grasping at low

hanging fruit. A task beneath such logical
creatures as ourselves.

Or, it might be a powerful demonstration

of the fact that we have control, or at
least a leash,

around how we feel.

We condemn the actions

of serial killers but nonetheless often
treat them

like rock stars. Web sites like RedrumAutographs and Serial Killers Ink

sell autographs, souvenirs, trinkets
and works of art

made by real serial killers.

Some call it murderabilia. On a spectrum of
petty thrills and morose voyeurism

to complete overwhelming obsession and fear,

our relationship with the morbid is
complicatedm

but it is under our control if we're aware

of our actions. One of the most
constructive and socially important

uses of the morbid is the facilitation of meaning, acceptance

and empathy.

In his book 'Everyone Loves a Good Train Wreck'

Eric G. Wilson says that our attraction
to the macabre is

on some level a desire to experience

someone else's suffering.

Morbid curiosity is often about the
imagination.

Imagining what it would be like to be that
other person, what if that happened

to me? Could it happen to me?

Empathetic feelings remind us that our
time is limited

and that we are fragile and in doing so
bring us

closer together. Sure enough, the last
movie I watched it made me want to go

out and hug the very first friend I could find

wasn't a happy feel-good comedy. Instead,

it was Louis Theroux's somber 'Extreme Love Dementia'.

Viewing unpleasant things

doesn't always make them less unpleasant
or any less real

but that's not always the point. Morbid
curiosity is

also about acceptance. Remember,

our brains are wired with motivations
to explore

unpleasant things, because doing so
can be preferable

to ignorance.

Gawking at morbidity is often about asking why?

There must be a reason, a meaning behind all of this.

When tragedy strikes or horrors are
revealed, we listen to experts give opinions,

neighbors describe the killer, we look for
signs that were missed

and confirmation that others feel the same
way we do,

that people are helping or making sure
justice

is served. Katelin Dodi the host of 'Ask a
Mortician'

here on YouTube just wrote a phenomenal book

'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes and Other
Lessons

from the Crematory'.

In the book she says

"accepting death doesn't mean that you won't be
devastated when someone you love dies,

it means you will be able to focus on
your grief, unburdened by bigger

existential questions, like

why do people die? And why is this
happening to me?

Death isn't happening to you, death

is happening to us all." That's heavy stuff

but acceptance like that is one of the
greatest things morbid

curiosity has to offer and don't worry,

there's a funny side to all of this, or at least

a funny side related to this

and how morbidity helps us make sense of the world.

A study in Finland found that children were four
times as likely to be scared

by their usual television programs if a parent

was in the room.

It surprised researchers
but one explanation lies

in the "Uh oh, Mom flinched theory".

The idea is that to a young child almost
everything is brand new

but parents are older, they're wiser, they know what's normal

and if they are scared of what's on TV

uh oh... How we feel and how we feel about
how we feel

is to a large degree learned. There's a
theory about the origin of humor

called the encryption theory of humor. It
suggests that one of the great roles humor

plays is in measuring who is inside and
who is outside,

who is similar and who is socially
or ideologically

too different. Jokes test what
researchers call

unstated common knowledge the teller and
listener

both share.

So might we be

morbidly curious for the same reason we
enjoy telling jokes?

Jokes assess underlying shared

attitudes. Morbidity helps us asses shared

underlying attitudes of an existential

variety, morality and justice.

Whether it's used for empathetic or
exploitative reasons,

morbidity and laughter may share

a similar adaptive role. We are morbidly
curious

because we like to scream but more
strangely

the yuk...and the yuk yuk

overlap.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
