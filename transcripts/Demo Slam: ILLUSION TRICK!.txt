hey Vsauce Michael here with a special

video today this video is my submission

to Google demo slam and the technology

I'm using is personalized Google

homepage

I took 29 pictures of myself in what are

clearly comfortable positions and then I

isolated each picture and I've uploaded

them sequentially to 29 different

browser windows I'm uploading the last

one right now and I'm gonna line it up

perfectly right on top of the other 28

yep 29 browser windows now all I have to

do is hold down the keyboard shortcut

for minimize and like a flipbook you'll

be able to watch me slam dunk a

basketball through the second oh and

Google looking good good form there's

the second oh and uh oh slam I'm not

very good at basketball
