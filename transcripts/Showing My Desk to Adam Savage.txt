hey Vsauce Michael here the eye is a

mirror when you look into an eye you can

see a small tiny version of yourself

that kind of looks like a doll version

of yourself the latin word for a little

doll is a few pilla that's where we get

the word pupil for a young student and

the word pupil for the dark hole in the

middle of your eye

it's a pupil because when you look into

it you see the pupil of yourself

the tiny doll version of you and you are

in for a treat today something a little

bit different than usual but I think

you'll like it I've been working with

Adam Savage on our tour brain candy live

and I decided to give him a tour of my

brain candy the little things I have on

my desk the desk I work at everyday that

are sweet to the noggin but before that

here is a sneak peek at brain candy live

but not really this is this is brain

candy right here we've been literally

yeah this is the show we we've been the

last couple of days here and all the

little colored pieces of paper right for

you it's blurred because we don't want

to give it away yeah well maybe give

that one away psych you've got to come

to the show oh yeah let's not mess this

up this is how I think through a

narrative it's either like this or on a

whiteboard yeah I can't actually type it

out linearly yeah and you can see how

dense parts are you can see by colors

where the audience is involved where

there's gonna be something dangerous and

how they'll maybe spread those out

properly okay but wait this is not why

we're here we're here because we're in

Michael's amazing Vsauce space in Los

Angeles and I happen to notice that your

desk is awesomely messy and yet covered

with stuff that I wanted to get my hands

on and

we realized we should just shoot that so

yeah let me know I wanted to clean it up

but I don't kind of convinced me

no the way it is is the way we're gonna

film it so this is just pure

unadulterated truth that's really what

I'm about

all right so why why do you feel like a

little bit reticent to show off this is

awesome by the way your deaths you

couldn't set design this with this much

chaos let you like a photo to go off of

but I'm nervous because I mean I don't

know there could be something here that

I'm like oh that's embarrassing like you

know okay here's a half drank energy

drink from yesterday I'm gonna finish

this today I like a flat I like a

room-temperature I don't really want to

show you this Stirling engine this is so

precisely made it is powered just by the

heat of your hand so put your palm out

and then we'll let that warm up for just

a second meanwhile yeah yeah keep all

that blood in your hand but the thing is

it doesn't need a lot of heat underneath

it it just needs a temperature

difference between the surface on top

here the disk on top and the disk that's

touching your hand so while you're

holding that because I'm able to get

that bottom warmed up a little bit it's

a funny phrase I hear

let's admire some India India India it

is the only element in the universe you

can chew like bubblegum what it's a soft

metal it gets softer when warm but it's

also non-toxic and it's it's quite rare

I heard it's on the endangered elements

list in a hundred years there might not

be really any found in the ground so is

this a particularly large chunk of

then in a hundred years it might be or

it might not be I mean this is there's

some guesswork involved in knowing what

the earth has and what it's gonna run

out of I'm dancing it with my fingernail

exactly and you can take a bite out of

it I wouldn't recommend it because it's

quite cold in here and it could be a

little firmer than your teeth once but I

took a piece off and I melted it in this

beaker because you can make awesome

mirrors with it this is like a wonderful

wish list for me of other things to play

with because I think if we went to if we

went through my desk and my space at my

shop there'd be a whole bunch of stuff

you'd be like oh I didn't know those

existed we gotta get those yeah I'm

gonna give it just a little turn all

right but as you'll notice even though I

didn't put that much energy in it won't

slow down it's just gonna keep going how

does this engine work well it's all

about temperature a kinetic approach to

defining temperature the air is made of

molecules movin and shakin around

they're collisions produce what we call

air pressure now we say that warm air

expands but really it just has more

energy when a gas warms up its kinetic

energy increases it's molecules

literally move faster translationally

rotationally and vibrationally as a

result the average force they all exert

when colliding increases if the

container they're in isn't perfectly

rigid these collisions stronger on

average than those coming from the other

side will push the containers walls out

expanding the space within now that's

what happens in our engine our engine

has two Pistons a power piston

responsible for moving the big wheel and

a displacer piston that shuttles around

the air inside your hand warms the air

inside giving it more kinetic energy

enough to push the power piston up

turning the wheel the wheels motion then

pushes the displacer down moving the air

away from the warmer bottom plate

causing it to rapidly cool and collide

with the containers walls and the power

piston less often and with less force so

the piston falls turning the wheel with

it

the wheels momentum now drags the disk

laser piston up pushing air down to the

warm plate where it gains energy

collides with the power piston more

powerfully again sending it back up

beginning the cycle again it's

surprising just how quickly air can cool

and warm enough to move the piston it's

fast a classic example of this is the

old egg-sucking trick put something

burning in a bottle and stick a peeled

boiled egg on top

then suddenly poop the egg plops into

the bottle this is often explained as

being caused by a vacuum forming in the

bottle because the oxygen inside got

used up leaving fewer molecules within

to combat the pressure coming from

without but that's not true the oxygen

used by the fire doesn't disappear from

the universe that would violate the laws

of physics instead the flame turns it

into things like water vapor and carbon

dioxide

there are however fewer molecules in the

bottle when the egg is placed on top but

not because they were destroyed by a

fire instead it's because the heat of

the flame gave them enough energy to

push their way out air pushing against

the egg can get out because the egg is

shaped in such a way that lifting it

opens this seal but once the flame burns

out the air inside starts to cool right

away and well there's less of it inside

now external atmospheric pressure is

stronger but the shape of the egg is

such that pushing this way only tightens

the seal the air inside continues

cooling pushing less and less until the

pressure difference is enough that the

entire egg gets pushed in and that's a

piece of brain candy if you ask me the

egg isn't sucked into the bottle so much

as it's just pushed in by the atmosphere

because the pressure inside which would

normally be pushing back equally has

become weaker likewise you don't really

suck liquid up through a straw you just

cause the air in your mouth to push

against it through the straw less than

usual so the air outside can win against

you and push the liquid into your mouth

so make sure the haters know

scientifically nothing sucks anyway back

to how messy my desk is I think this

does give a good sense of

what's in my mind and how facades look -

it's like kind of an S this is what an

episode looks like in your head before

it comes yeah and my tolerance for mess

is really high okay so if I need her to

work

I wouldn't even move anything I'd be

like look the trackpad and a keyboard

are accessible yeah yeah yeah but it's

also inspiring to have little things

around to fidget with for instance these

cast puzzles but that one is called

spiral oh wow the craftsmanship one on

some of these puzzles is just I didn't

realize it was a puzzle I just don't

think in that not all those pieces come

apart they do yeah

that doesn't seem possible exactly and

that what they do is they I think

exercise the part of my brain that deals

with three-dimensional realization

because I don't think I'm very good at

that it takes me weeks to see something

in my head so I'm trying to like you

know what these are really good for is

finger strength because they're heavy

and if you tore out of one for a whole

day yeah you're like oh my gosh I'm

getting some some nice tone when you sit

up at the seeing something in your head

I mean that's the same way I build stuff

I can't start building unless I can see

the structure in my head do you think

you look really good at visualizing

things in your mind yeah no actually

there's a there's a turn that happens

and as a maker where you start being

able to just build stuff in your head

Wow and turning it over to drive with

the turtles did practice make it a

better skill totally practice makes it a

better skill and every time I attack a

new material it's the same thing this is

another that's another one and that one

is really fascinating because as you

pull it apart you don't see what's

catching right how come it's not

oh right no matter which way you hold it

and they're going to lock itself these

are like really modern Appalachians like

wire puzzles now watch watch this I

don't know if we can get a close-up of

this but if you've got pins that are

falling because of gravity this way and

this way

there's no way to unlock it unless you

get some little centrifugal force

happening or more precisely there

inertia will cause them to move out and

if I give that a little spin it just

falls apart Wow force it it just wants

to fall apart once you've spun that

beautiful so yeah I've got a lot of

stuff here what I'm picking up all the

puzzles okay this is a play with those

well yeah these later boil the solutions

for those out there watching who should

really get into my love topology stuff

at the moment these are Spears that

dissect into a bunch of pieces I bought

at the dollar store three for a dollar

but yet the the mechanism or the or the

design behind it is so clever and so

easy to put back together right I

actually instagrammed it I was so like

excited about the simplicity yeah how it

comes apart and goes together this is um

we when we finished Mythbusters we

packed up my desk and it was exactly

like this like a couple of hundred

pounds of this stuff yes this desk is

super heavy for a few reasons one is the

tungsten cube oh there it is

isn't that surprising ah this is larger

but not as heavy and that's solid steel

that's a

it's a plumb bob and I used that in the

what if the earth stopped spinning video

it was so heavy I could it like actually

tape a camera to it and then have the

camera on a pendulum so I'm noticing

you've got a lot of a lot of materials

different materials and I saw you open

this one earlier

oh I think they opened down yeah so this

is a density cube set each cube is one

inch by one inch by one inch and it

gives you a really good idea of density

and how different things feel one of my

favorite things to do is because

different metals have different thermal

conductivity I will like pull some at

what once copper ones that have a let's

let's do I are anything copper and I'll

mix them up so I don't know which one is

which and I'll just put them on my

forehead and I'll try to guess which is

which by which one feels cooler and the

one that feels cooler should be copper

it has a hopper on that can feel cooler

the question is which one is covered I

feel like the cooler one is it's Michael

Michael school that's for all the

coolest but between these two the cooler

is

I can't get this wrong I think you

actually can't get it wrong yeah I

actually can but I'm thinking that this

one's copper you got it hey hey I can

tell you've got a little anxiety about

that work

I knew I could do it if I didn't get it

right on camera I'd look like a fool my

desk by the way happens to be littered

with pens that you can't really see in

the video they are pins that are

erasable because the ink inside of them

becomes invisible when heated you can

erase the ink in this pin by just

rubbing the other end of the pen over

the ink heating it up to the invisible

point a really fun way to erase a lot of

stuff at once is to just use a flame

these are is also a density set but in

this case every cylinder is 100 grams

that's 100 grams of aluminum and this is

LED and that's LED and then we got brass

copper

I think zinc and and steel it's that a

standard tarnish on lead I don't know

because it's tarnished the part that's

it

that's the edge in the wood the reason

I'm asking is moisture or something one

of the original Maltese Falcons two of

the original multi sockets were made out

of lead and they now have this very dark

brown patina on them and I have wondered

never wondered aloud but I have wondered

if Brown patina is something that

happens - it must but why did it not

happen on the court that was exposed to

the air I'm actually noticing a

interesting pagina on the brass and the

copper as well from the contact with the

woods yeah could be oils in the wood the

multi soften could be Brown from many

people handling yeah it could be alright

so what do you think is the worst thing

someone could conclude looking at your

desk I wouldn't be sad if it concluded

that I was disorganized because that's

true right well there's disorganization

and there's disorganization you're not

inhibited from getting your work done

well yeah exactly that is a piece of

calcite that has that birefringence

property right where if you what's it

good out here that's double vision

except it does double vision yeah see

I'm not disorganized I can find a legal

pad in a second

absolutely so let's just draw like a

circle yeah that's not a great circle

that's right and then rotate it

oh no way yeah okay so what is the most

recent object - yeah thanks for parking

my loose tooth what's the most recent

thing you've you've brought into the

space the most recent I guess with oh

that's really cool isn't it cool that's

a call the TV rock it's a piece of black

site with fiber optic properties cool I

found out that the famous fact about

polar bear first supposed to be fiber

optic it's not true oh is it not true

apparently it's not so I didn't even

know that fact but if you were to tell

me and I would believe it

ya know it's a total it's one of those

silly oh yeah totally I buy a newest

object newest object it's the speaker oh

I saw this yesterday yes that came in

the in the curiosity box this third one

and it's it looks like a laboratory

beaker but it's a you know double wall

thing with the handle you can drink

coffee out of and it has milliliter

measurements on it but I was like

milliliters we've heard about those

let's use some crazy uses right so what

do you value my blood in your brain is

the amount of saliva produced every

three hours during the day if you fill

it all the way up to 300 milliliters it

also tells you that filled too here the

beaker contains approximately 10 septal

Ian water molecules I should of course

point out the spit error I misspelled

saliva on the Beger on every beaker in

fact it's completely my fault I take

full blame and spit if you are out there

watching please know that I respect you

even though I'm not perfect I'm gonna

move past this because I just did a rack

focus on the globe and am i right that

that is one of those bespoke globes made

by that company in England

yeah Ballard b globes yeah oh okay yeah

well you can go get it

it's not really a surprise that I love

globes I've done a lot of videos about

what does the earth look like how our

map projections made and this was a gift

from my wife on our wedding day what I

am flattered if you look up at the top

of the globe it has written the company

that made it a minute he says our names

right and then it's got the place of our

wedding in the date

and in the base which is over there and

it has a plaque that says to my husband

on our wedding day

so these globes are the most accurate I

know I'm very familiar with these Globes

as I go to their website every few weeks

and think that they make them really

large they make what's called the

Churchill yeah and you couldn't even hug

it IIIi think this is a reasonable place

to stop the the desk store I'm just

gonna go off into a corner and look at

this for a couple yeah sure of course

I'll get some work done

hey you saw Michael here so there you go

brain candy live hits the road on

February 21st traveling to 40 cities

around the United States check brain

candy live.com to see which cities were

coming to for probably coming to one

near you the rest of our global viewers

please don't worry we are considering

and looking at tours and the rest of

this beautiful glow but for right now

it's just the United States see you out

there on the road and as always thanks

for watching

but wait there's more let's talk about

the eye specifically

blinking we all do it it's good for our

eyes to blink but is there a chance that

at some point in the future there will

come a moment during which every single

pair of eyes on earth every single human

is blinking at the exact same time a

moment we will all miss do tube linkage

you blink your eyes anywhere from 30

times a minute all the way down to well

just three or four times a minute if

you're fixated on something like when

reading that can actually explain

partially why your eyes might become dry

or fatigued while reading also a typical

blink lasts about 100 to 300

milliseconds which means if you are

awake for 16 hours a day and you blink

say 10 times a minute on average and

your blinks are just to be conservative

here only a hundred milliseconds long in

a waking day

you spend about 16 minutes of your life

in blink mode with your eyes closed

that's a lot of minutes to miss everyday

but what about all of us blinking

together well the math has been done on

Reddit and the chances aren't good there

is a zero point zero zero zero zero zero

four billion more zeros 1% chance that

today every single human will blink

their eyes at the same time or have them

closed because they're asleep that is a

very small chance even given the number

of days in the universe's life so far

you just wouldn't expect to have ever

seen it happen or to ever see it happen

so remember earth we are always watching

and as always thanks for watching
