ooh it's a nerd balls it's a nerd wars

it's the all-female edition who we got

so today I'm nerd warriors we're gonna

be doing some girl-on-girl action with

Elektra vs. Barber Crofton now yes thank

you XD minus X deficit Adam can't talk

don't be offended he's done a couple of

them already we used one of them keep

sending them post them if you got more

anyway yeah well I'm gonna be arguing as

always the side of comic books and I'm

sorry there's no way that Laura Croft

could be an electric she's an

accomplished martial artist she's an

assassin assassin she's come back from

the dead

alright so is Laura you know how many

times I died playing the original tomb

raider mostly because the camera

controls around look at me

whoo there you go that's that's half the

argument right there she comes back from

the dead all the time but she can die in

a puddle of water and I will say this

Electric's got a worse outfit Elektra

Elektra doesn't even wear paint and in a

combat boots I don't know there's

something about combat boots and a knife

that just mm yeah arable so you see

here's the thing with Laura Croft all

right Laura Croft is a nobody enough

she's awesome she's got big Botox he

lives six kids the most attractive

husband on the planet that's an elite

bread that's Angelina Jolie that's not

even Laura Croft whatever okay okay fine

what fine Angelina Jolie playing Laura

Croft beets what's her face as Electra

no we're not gonna talk about Jennifer

Garner yeah no no no yeah no Angelina

Jolie's way hotter than Jennifer Garner

hell yeah Angelina Jolie why is it every

year she looks more and more like a

walking skeleton it's like Skeletor

she's like female what's this what's

this that's magic everywhere what's this

what's this I'm Angelina Jolie what that

you know like Jack Skellington she used

to be so hot eat a sandwich yeah when

she was in Gia oh my god if you haven't

rented you go ready to go Electra

yeah played by Jennifer Garner Angelina

Jolie wins check no that's not an

argument over you know over no over over

here's the thing here's the thing

halfway through the fight with Elektra

all right

Angelina Jolie would have to stop so she

could make out with her brother at an

awards show

a good point but that'd be hot no that

was it was a brother dude I don't care

see show making out their tongues in

each other's mouths I don't care so she

should I don't know them it was hot that

she was just kissing on the screen she

had sex with Billy Bob Thornton oh

that's a good point that's point electro

right there yeah that is white electric

point Lara Croft

electric couldn't handle Billy Bob

Thornton what huh yeah uh Laura Croft

came out alive she did a second movie oh

yeah yeah what do you mean she couldn't

handle Billy Bob Thornton what you

couldn't handle Billy Bob Thornton he's

not just your run-of-the-mill criminal

there's the fight jennifer aniston

versus um Angelina Angelina Jolie who

would win in a fight right now

Angelina Jolie Angelina you really think

she's got this bowling ball she just

like yeah but she her bat can't even

support him anymore Jennifer Anne seems

to be doing fine every time I say wrong
