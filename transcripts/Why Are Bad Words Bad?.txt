Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

When you call customer service

and hear this "to ensure quality service

your call may be monitored or recorded",
they're not kidding.

Over the last year the Marchex Institute
analysed more than 600,000

recorded phone conversations Americans made

to businesses in the United States.

Turns out, people from Ohio were the most likely

to use curse words - the 'A' word, 
the 'F' word and the 'S' word.

Washington state residents were
the least likely to use bad words.

But what makes

a word bad?

Oh, be careful because etymologically speaking

even the word 'bad' can be considered a bad word.

It began in old English as a derogatory term

for an effeminate man.
Eighty percent of swear words overheard

in public in 1986, 1997 and 2006

were essentially the same.
One third of all counts included

the top two - the 'F' word and the 'S' word.

Slate's brilliant Lexicon Valley podcast purported that

these 10 words makeup about 0.7% of the average

English speakers daily vocabulary, which means

socially unacceptable words are used almost as often

as socially descriptive words.
First person plural pronouns account for about

1% of the words we say everyday.

When a bad word is bleeped, it is covered with a 1

kilohertz sine wave, which sounds like this.

Son of a ...

By the way, the symbols and
squiggles that are used to represent

a bad word have a name.
They're called grawlixes.

They were named by Mort Walker in his seminal

"The Lexicon of Comicana." 
He names a lot of things but most of

them show stuff, they don't hide stuff.

Why the need to hide bad words, especially if we all

pretty much know what's being said?
Well, there is no one single reason bad words

are bad.

Steven Pinker in his excellent lecture
on the topic delineates

five types of swearing.
First of all, some words are bad

on purpose.
They are created and/or used with the intent

to hurt others.
He calls this "abusive swearing."

Using words to insult, humiliate, objectify

or marginalise disfavoured people.

Now, if that this disfavoured person is

God, we're talking about supernatural swearing,

which was particularly taboo in Victorian times.

It was believed that casually or vainly referring

to God would physically injure God himself,

literally. So, at the time people were
forced to come up with euphemisms,

like "Zounds!" and "Gadzooks!", which  originally meant

"God's Wounds!" and "God's Hooks!",

referring to the nails driven through the hands of Jesus.

Historically, swear words often
came from things we were

afraid of, things we perceived as dangerous,

stronger than us and mercurial. Such as

death, disease and infirmity, sex

and sexually transmitted diseases,
as well as body fluids,

germy, gross effluvia. Words

for those gross things became gross
and bad in and of themselves,

uncouth

to speak.

But not all words for gross things are

socially unacceptable, which brings us to Pinker's

second type of swearing - emphatic swearing.

Emphatic swearing is where the
taboo-ness of bad words

becomes quite practical.
You wouldn't usually use those words but when you

really want to convey that your current
emotions matter more to you than proper

social conduct,

you can use them.

Dysphemism.

A euphemism is kind, acceptable word
that allows you to talk about something

unpleasant

while simultaneously letting everyone know you totally

get that it's unpleasant and want to respect that.

For instance, if you want to be
professional, you wouldn't say s***.

You might say 'defecate'. If, on the other hand,
you really want to drive home just

how unpleasant

the experience was, dysphemisms can help out a lot.

It wasn't a bag of canine defecation you found on your

front porch, it was a s*** bag of hot

dog s***.
Both of these words refer to pretty much the same thing

but they have different levels of
social acceptability and that's

very helpful. It means word choice allows us to not only

refer to things in the real world but also

to how we feel about them.

If both these words had the same level
of social acceptance

we might even have to find new, badder
words so as not to lose the power

language currently has to express

emotion,

repulsion and disgust.

But when it comes to two words
referring to the same thing, but

with different levels of social acceptance,
who decides which one's

good and which one's bad?
Well, historically, many of the bad words we

use today

are the result of class differences.

In medieval England, the lower-class Saxons

spoke a Germanic tongue while the upper-class

Normans spoke a language related to French and Latin.

English, as we know it today,
contains many consequences

of their differences. 
The lower class worked with animals and

from them we get animal names. The upper class

only ate the animals, which is where
the names of the meat

come from. Today's swear words

are similar.
Defecation stems from fancy pants

Latin, whereas the less classy s***

is Germanic. There's also idiomatic swearing,

where nothing is being emphasized.

No dysphemism is meant;
instead, it's an easygoing type of

swearing that shows an atmosphere is casual.

Bad words can be used,
we're all close here. It's okay to swear,

we're all cool.

Cathartic swearing

is a bit different. It gives us "lalochezia,"

the medical term for the relief swearing provides

when you're in pain. In the brain, swearing

seems to involve different regions
than regular language,

which may explain why people with
aphasia caused by brain damage

struggle to comprehend or construct spoken words

but yet are fluent at swearing.

Or why people with coprolalia control

normal language just fine, but involuntarily utter

profanity, an obscene words.

It turns out

swearing may be centralized in the limbic system,

along with the motions.
Many animals make automatic

noises when in pain or threat to startle or intimidate

attackers, or to let others know what's going on.

In humans, bad words are great for this purpose.

Their taboo-ness makes them special.
People wouldn't use them otherwise,

so they are great alarms. Swearing

is changing.
Some bad words are being used more and more

frequently. Of the seven words, George
Carlin said you could never say on

television.

Today, every second

22 of them are sent out on Twitter.

So, what will swearing look like in the future?

It probably won't go away altogether, it's too useful.

But the words we don't like will likely change.

History has shown that as disease
becomes less scary and sex and the

supernatural

more personal, words related to them 
become less taboo

and more common; 
whereas words that were common in the past

are increasingly unpleasant. Perhaps, in the future,

spurt not by runaway political correctness but by wider

knowledge, words like "schizo", "mental",

"aspy", or even "depressed" will take the square stage.

Or as John McWhorter ventured,
words centered around class and the gap

between

opportunity and disadvantage will become more

taboo. Salt of the Earth, trash,

chav, pikey, urban as a pejorative.

When McKay Hatch started a "No Cussing Club"

at his school, his campaign became the
target of so many online jokes and

insults for being lame or anti-free speech.

On his book, he literally subtitled his own name

"the most cyberbullied kid in the world."

People care about this stuff.
Is it censorship

to tell us what we can and cannot say or

is it a safety seal, ensuring certain
dysphemisms don't get worn down to a

quotidian

bluntness like every other word?

Or is that badness of bad words a

boundary, a moving boundary of we

reject - sometimes arbitrary,

sometimes irrational, but always moving
in the direction of acceptance

moving forward?

Crime and inequality have existed ever since

they could. But when N.W.A released a
reaction, in the form of a song with bad

word in the title,

"F*** the Police",
the Federal Bureau of Investigations released

a statement against the song.
It was the only time,

up until then and since,
the FBI has ever issued an official statement

about a work of art.

Bad words have power.

If you wanna push for change you'll need something

to push. If everything's fine,

nothing's cool.

So, bad words are the precipitate of a larger

reaction - the process of us slowly becoming

what we want to become.

That's some deep s***.

And as always,

 thanks for watching.
