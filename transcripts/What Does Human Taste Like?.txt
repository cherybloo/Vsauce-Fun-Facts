Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

Eating your own boogers

is gross, but it might be smart. Assuming you have

clean fingers, lung specialist
Friedrich Bischinger points out that snot

contains antiseptic enzymes that kill

or weaken bacteria. Reintroducing

those crippled microorganisms may allow
your immune system to develop antibodies

in relative safety. Now, that is good to know-

-nose. But is eating your own snot

cannibalism(?) Self

cannibalism. Just like a cow or chicken or
fish or fruit or vegetable you are made out of alot of

edible things. The meat on an average human
body contains 77,000 dietary calories worth

of nutritional energy. Yum(!) If you decide to
become a cannibal, just don't show up late for dinner

or you'll get the cold shoulder.

Jokes aside, cannibalism is a major

taboo. It's off-putting at a visceral level.

Humans have dignity, they are more
than just skin bags full of organs.

They're more than just

something to put on a plate.
But human meat has been put on

plates... and in bellies.
There are reports of cannibalism occurring

in times of famine as a last resort, and because of

curiosity and art. In the late 1980s,

artist Rick Gibson publicly ate human tonsils

and other donated human parts in London and Canada.

In 2006, artist Marco Evaristti cooked and canned

meatballs prepared with his own body fat,

removed via liposuction. In 2011,

Dutch TV presenters Dennis Storm and 
Valerio Zeno cooked and ate

pieces of each other on a TV show whose title

meant "guinea pigs".
Because both of them lived, and

both consented to the act, they didn't do anything

illegal. One year later, a Japanese man posted

this tweet. Five diners took up his offer
and on April 13th, 2012,

they were served a $250 per plate meal consisting

of his genitals. A darker story occurred in 2001,

when Armin Meiwes ate and killed

a volunteer he found on the now defunct Cannibal Cafe.

Although his meal ostensibly consented to the menu,

Meiwes was convicted of murder and

now, serving a life sentence in prison, has become

a devout vegetarian. Disgust aside, one question

remains. If you were to use your taste buds

to taste your

bud, what would it taste like? To be clear,

taste is a sensation caused by something
in your mouth chemically reacting with receptors

in your taste buds. Flavor is the even more complex

experience of taste, combined with smell, and
information, from the trigeminal nerve

about things like temperature, texture, pain

and pungency, as far as the cooked but otherwise

unadulterated spice-less, sauce-less flavor

of human meat. The late William Seabrook

provided, in my opinion, the best description.

While in West Africa, Seabrook
interviewed members of the Gear tribe,

people who

had eaten human flesh and found their
descriptions unsatisfactory. So,

when he returned to Paris he struck a
sneaky deal with an intern

at the Sorbonne and obtained a chunk

of human meat from an otherwise
healthy body recently involved

in an accident. He carefully prepared
the meat and wrote that,

quote, "It was like good, fully developed veal.

Not young, but not yet beef. It was

mild, good meet with no other sharply
defined or highly characteristic

tastes, such as, for instance, goat, high game

and pork. The steak was slightly tougher
than prime veal, a little stringy, but not

too tough or stringy

to be agreeably edible. The roast, from
which I cut and ate

a central slice, was tender and in color,

texture, smell as well as taste
strengthened my certainty

that, of all the meats we habitually know, veal

is the one meat to which at this meat is accurately

comparable."
Seabrook never gave us any
recipes or complementary flavor

recommendations.

But that brings us to this video's
title's second meaning.

What does human taste like?

What does the human palate prefer?
Interestingly,

of all the possible combinations of identified

flavors we consume, human cuisine only features

a relatively small number of recipes.

A couple of years ago scientific
reports published a great paper on

the chemistry and networks behind food pairing.

Researchers took 381 ingredients used in
five global cuisines

and 1,021 molecular compounds known to
contribute to their flavors

and created a flavor network.

The size of the bubble represents the
ingredients prevalence in cooking.

The thickness of the lines connecting
ingredients reflects the number

of flavor inducing molecules they significantly share.

The researchers' flavor network backbone spans

fourteen different food categories
and is quite interesting.

By comparing this network to tens of
thousands of recipes

they found that North American and
Western European dishes tend to combine

ingredients that share

flavor compounds, while East Asian cuisine

avoids them. But that trend was caused by a few

out lighters in each cuisine, that,
if ignored, caused the difference in amount

of sharing to lessen. Those few ingredients

tend to be the most authentic. They tend
to be the most responsible for the taste palette

of a regional cuisine and contribute to this

illuminating visualization.
But some flavors don't go together

in any cuisine. For instance, orange juice

and toothpaste. Why does orange juice taste
so disgusting right after brushing?

Well, most toothpastes contain sodium
lauryl sulfate - a chemical that helps the

paste get sudsy and frothy during use.

That action helps pull brushed off
debris away from your teeth,

but sodium lauryl sulfate also
suppresses sweet receptors

in your mouth and destroy phospholipids that inhibit

your bitter receptors, making sweet orange juice

taste not so sweet and grossly

bitter, for up to an hour after brushing.

What interests me the most about flavor
is the fact that the

things that cause it eventually become

you! You are what you eat, scientifically.

Your body is always losing dead cells
but the elements and molecules you

ingest are processed by your body into

new body. Here's a fun way to think about it.

Under the direction of DNA, a cat

is made out of air, water and cat food.

That's it. Cats have less varied diets than

humans. We can taste sweetness but cats

lack the gene required to do so.
However, they can taste

ATP, a molecule that moves around
chemical energy for cells to use in the

body, which may be a sign to them

that they're tasting meat. The point is,

sights and sounds and textures and shapes and smells

are the names we give to things that
eventually become our memories.

But flavor is the name we give to the
experience of things that eventually become

our bodies. Contemplating the

flavor of human meat is gross. But think of it this way:

you're currently tasting human,
you're tasting human right now.

Your tongue and taste buds are in
contact with your mouth

almost constantly. Now, granted, it's more
of a passive thing - your mouth just

happens to contain

your tongue. You're not actually eating

yourself... but you kind of are.

Your body is constantly swallowing
your own mucus

and digesting pieces of your body like
dead cells from your tongue

and cheek. But that's nothing
compared to the self cannibalism

of the sea squirt.
The sea squirt lives a sort of

self-cannibalistic 'Flowers for Algernon' life.

When born, it resembles a tadpole
and has a notochord,

putting it in the same phylum as humans.
It swims around until it finds a nice place

to adhere. A rock, a plant.

Once stuck, it begins retrogressive

metamorphosis. Literally digesting its own
nervous system, eating the closest thing

it ever had to a brain

and lives the rest of its life in a
sensile un-locomoting

clump. It is a bit of a downgrade,

but they are prime evidence that the
evolution of the brain was spawned by

the need

to move as soon.
As these guys don't need to move around,

they eat their brains.
That is way more extreme than the self-cannibalism

you participate in every day

by swallowing. But don't feel bad.
About every three months or so

you swallow and digest your own

body weight worth of you.

That means that every day you are a
little more than one percent of the

mythical

ouroboros, the snake eating its own tail.

You are what you eat but you are also a thing

that you eat.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
