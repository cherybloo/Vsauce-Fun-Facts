if pac-man was a real living organism

and party time wait what

[Music]

we start today like I start every day

wrapped up in covers oopah brought us

some great bedspreads this one would

make me feel less lonely this one's

great for parties and this one looks

like it does the opposite of cover you

thanks to videogame look-alikes calm the

Lich King looks like the witch-king the

doom guy looks like GI Joes Copperhead

Cybil Bennett looks like Cameron Diaz

and Mario looks like Stalin but none of

those can beat real-life girls dressed

up like Jessica Rabbit Manifest gave us

40 of them of course when in doubt samus

burlesque I wanted to buy my own samus

costume and my friend told me to use the

cook islands google domain so I went to

Google Doc Ock

and wait what at least this girl's

birthday is nice and she's got a normal

cake wait what Obama help me out wait

what

drip fist showed us 25 ill-advised

t-shirts but when the shirts come off

things get even better

crazy body shaming some are nerdy some

are classy some are romantic some are

superheroes and well there's this one

too want to see what chicken nuggets

look like before they're molded into

Nuggets shapes well here you go

mmm chicken paste the only thing worse

than that are male [ __ ] stamps but as

pop crunch showed me even chicas can get

it wrong as you read this [ __ ] stamp

the unique jerky way our eyes move will

cause these static swirls to seem to

actually spin yesterday to Daily Mail

posted this photo a photographer at the

Ryder Cup was actually hit in the chest

by Tigers shot but managed to take this

picture right before he got mail it's

cool but um how awesome is this guy so

awesome in fact that he's been used in

one of my favorite practices vertical

comics where we zoom in on the best face

make sure we get really close and then

zoom out to view complete facial

domination some of these are fun but

creepy some are pretty much lizard

no garbage one of my favorite bands I

see what you did there
