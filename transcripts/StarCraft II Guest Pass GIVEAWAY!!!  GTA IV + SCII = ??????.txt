hey Vsauce it's Michael and of course

Lucy and we have some really great news

for you I've been playing Starcraft 2 a

lot the past few days I've actually been

playing The Lost Viking more than the

actual game I mean that's worth $60

right speaking of games that just came

out recently I've also been playing a

lot of gta4 and I started thinking what

if we combined the two games GTA 4

Starcraft 2 sounds perfect right hello

Nico it looks like you're busy but go

bowling with me I want to go bowling

it's the least fun part of the game stop

what you're doing and go bowling with me

let's bowled if you don't do it I'm

gonna hate you okay yeah that would

totally suck Wow um well okay here's

something that doesn't suck in fact it's

the opposite of suck it blows um it's

just a it's just a good thing I've got

two pieces of exciting news first of all

I just bought a brand new character for

up all night

it cost a dollar fifty because up all

night is high budget entertainment

secondly if you don't already have

Starcraft 2 but you'd really like to

play I'm giving away both of my guest

passes to commenters below so leave a

comment any kind you want for the entire

weekend comment as often as you want and

on Tuesday at noon Eastern I will

release both of these codes to two

different people you'll get 7 hours of

gameplay or 14 days whichever happens
