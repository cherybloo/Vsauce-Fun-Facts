hey V saucers my name is Danielle and

I'm back today to tell you some games

that your girl will play with you and

she might actually like it now one of my

most recommended games to get your

girlfriend to play with you is Halo 3

Halo 3 is a really really simple

controlled firstperson shooter for Xbox

360 um the reasons that I personally

think that a girl would like this game

is because it's a first person shooter

so it's legit they don't feel like

you're dumbing your gaming down for them

it has objectives so even if you're not

necessarily great at pointing and aiming

and shooting um you can play a flag game

with your girl and you guys could work

together as a team to go get the flag

and capture and you can win the game

without her being able to play

whatsoever um I also really like Halo 3

because it's not gory and and with the

lack of gravity it's not realistic so

you don't feel like creeped out by like

shooting people or anything another

great idea for a game that you could get

your girl to play with you and she would

actually like it would be the new Super

Mario Brothers for Wii and this takes

everyone's favorite video game is Super

Mario Brothers for the original NES it

was like the first game that everybody

played everybody loves it if you don't

love Mario we aren't friends anymore I'm

so

sorry another awesome game to get your

girl to play with you that she'll

probably like is Geometry Wars for Xbox

360 you can download it right on the

arcade and the name itself sounds like

oh my gosh I'll never like this game

ever geometry um but it actually has

nothing to do with math at all it's sort

of like

asteroids Z sort of not really but kind

of um you play like this little guy and

he flies around and he's got this little

Trail like rainbow colors really awesome

colors it's got really awesome techno

music it's an awesome game for you to

play with your girlfriend especially if

she's not a gamer it only uses one

joystick on the control that's

it another game I would recommend to try

out playing with your girls we Sports uh

Wii Sports was like the first Wii game I

ever tried my sister has a Wii I don't

wish I did what are you going to do um

but it was the first game that I ever

played on whe and I thought it was a

blast I wanted to try every single game

I think that either tennis or baseball

was my favorite but I'm not sure they're

all fun um it's got really cool

multiplayer so you can play against each

other but kind of together at the same

time you're up you're moving um my arm

was actually sore the next day from

playing the tennis over and over and

over again and of course being that I am

the host I could not include World of

Warcraft on this list uh World of

Warcraft is my favorite video game to

play by far lots of girls play it it's

not I I mean I think stereo typically

it's a male dominant game but there are

a lot of girls who play World of

Warcraft there's a lot of really pretty

places in World of Warcraft the story

lines are very interesting questing is

fun instancing is fun it's fun being

important being a tank or a Healer or a

DPS it is just a really really fun game

and it is a great game to play with your

girlfriend you can play if you're right

next to each other you can play if

you're across the country I am a huge

fan I love it if you play World of

Warcraft definitely try to get your

girls R to play with you show her this

video I am obsessed with World of

Warcraft I love it and I think it is

just I'm just a huge huge fan oh I

almost forgot the winners of the

Starcraft 2 guest passes are solar
