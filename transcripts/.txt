hello again and welcome to up all night

I'm a knight I'm a horse neigh

last week on the show we covered a bunch

of great ways to prank news today I'm

gonna do the same thing all over again

because I have no imagination it's

opposite day

we begin today with a PC trick we're

gonna remap the Internet Explorer icon

first I need to find myself a screen

saver so I'm gonna go down to the Start

menu and go to search all files and

folders I'm gonna search asterisk dot

SCR and your screen savers will show up

a really quick and easy way to get the

target destination for these screen

savers is to right-click on them and

send them to the desktop as a shortcut

now that I've got a shortcut for the

screen saver on my desktop I can right

click on the icon choose properties and

then copy the target destination once

I've got that on my clipboard I'm going

to go up to my internet explorer icon

right-click properties and paste in the

screen saver target destination now

anytime someone comes to this computer

to open up Internet Explorer they get

the screen saver they can always move

the mouse to cancel the screen saver but

when they try to open Internet Explorer

again boom screen saver screen saver

over and over and over again if you want

to be really silly you can change the

target destination to this code which

you'll find in the description when

double clicked an icon with this

destination will actually restart the

entire computer Oh No

my saddle is my clothes we're all fans

of the slow minimized but did you know

that you can use terminal to freeze the

slow minimize while it's happening all

you have to do is open up terminal

applications utilities terminal type in

kill all space doc do ck with a capital

D but don't press ENTER now go to any

type of window that you want to mess up

and hold down shift then click minimize

you'll get a weird wavy pattern go back

to terminal quickly and press ENTER and

boom the window is frozen in a weird

shape but can still be used it's

completely functional that's more cool

than a bag of oats and of course to

return it to its normal shape all you

have

minimize the window and bring it back up

again

copy the JavaScript in this video's

description and paste it into your

browser's address bar press Enter and

all of a sudden every image on the

screen will break free and spin around

like crazy oh pretty

you

I'm gonna be glue someday

you
