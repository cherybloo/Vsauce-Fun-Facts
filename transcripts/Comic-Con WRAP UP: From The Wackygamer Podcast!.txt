we're here to talk about comic-con what

to comic-con me a lot fun we wanted to

tell you what our favorites and this

favorites this did spray I think this

favorites is a word we're gonna stick

with it alright I think my number one

favorite what was it women in costumes

costumes were pretty near to God pretty

hot my god I don't know why attractive

women are swarming towards nerds but

please keep doing it my favorite would

have to be female Boba Fett that was

pretty hot i-i've never thought that

that Boba Fett could inspire an erection

female Kratos was hot oh Jesus Christ

that was that was bad in costume why am

i attract what is it about women

dressing as male characters that somehow

makes it even hotter I don't know but

here I saw Lady Deadpool wasn't showing

an inch of skin still Oh hot so hot

shown the face at all not even wearing

the mask wow I don't know why Desperate

Dan Lee was in the house Stan Lee was in

the house and you've gotta love Stan Lee

I'm gonna I'm gonna preamp this by

saying I love Stan Lee no matter what

Stan Lee's pretty austere King that

being said Stan Lee has gone senile and

people are willing I don't be he's gone

scene he's a little scene out and people

are still clapping no matter what he

says so I'm gonna data true I'm at a

panel and I'm watching and they're like

Stan Lee who's your favorite superhero

who's your favorite superhero you made

when I was growing up soda cost a nickel

and now I have a chair in my shadow

country and in everybody claps yes Ted

show the clip you show Waki gamer calm

we'll have the full talk that I recorded

cuz I was on the other side of the room

but there was a point where they're

talking about the game cuz it's the

Marvel games talk and Stanley just

chimes in I just want to say something

and it's not even relevant to the tough

but these guys are all really smart

these guys are the smartest people

excelsior and I want it just again I

love Stan we do love Stanley please

you're watching this we love you he got

a anything new people clap people

clapping we don't have that wouldn't if

we don't have that I can't go on say to

be like I like pudding and then ever

yeah Adams alive

he's fat oh okay next topic the

proliferation of cheap [ __ ] and we all

know how much Adam looks cheap seen so

much cheap stuff yes my first day there

I found a 75% off of trade back table

and I spent my paper bags trade

paperback table

I spent a hundred and fifty down and

then he comes back to the hotel he's

like dude you didn't tell me to leave my

wallet I I bought so many comic books

it's it's really sad and now I'm reading

them on the bus and everybody's looking

at me like I'm mentally deficient it's

awesome it is awesome it is awesome

everyone's now seeing what I already

knew reading ultimate x-men investing -

they give away a lot of free stuff lots

of rights DC was giving away copies

everything I got this one because I

thought it was funny video game nerds

driver and the best part is if you go

into the driver comic I'm like I got it

cuz I'm like ridiculous they're making a

comic about driving so let's let's look

at the story this is on page one you got

page page two and three there's two and

three are good and page four and five

and then up the comics over just have

character it was as bad as I was

expecting you know I'll say this when I

was playing the game driver I was like I

need to know more about this story of

this muffler yeah I'm like all I'm

seeing is the back of a car but what's

happening inside the car how many

transmissions has he burned out on the

way to this car a lot a lot I thought it

was cool I got to see a bunch of artists

while I was there I went and did the

sketchbook thing I'm a sketch book right

here show you a little stuff I'm not

gonna be able to talk much with it but

you can see here who's that Adam who's

that okay that would be Green Lantern it

is Green Lantern hey Libra Meho did a

really good Joker I actually have a

video of this hopefully I'll post it on

my kitchen or comedy but I corded him

doing this actually doing this sketch

and my favorite was one of the guys at

Pixar see that right here it's a his

character this beaver would you call it

yeah it's a beaver it's a beaver talking

to our 2d - who's projecting the beaver

can eat that's it for [ __ ] so oh that's

pretty cool let's film Captain America

though Oh Captain America is pretty

badass pretty good that's pretty [ __ ]

badass so we gotta find everything there

you go here's Captain America all these

for free just went around to the artists

table talk to them they're more than

willing to do this for me and this is

Dave Wilkins

it does many in Captain America so

lesson being next year at comic-con

bring a book full of blank pages for

these people to draw in they are

desperate for attention they are they

just want to meet the fans they really

the writers tend to get a lot of the

intention the artist artists artists are

just happy to have people over they do

do full commission a lot of them charge

to be like full-page colors but if

they're not busy they're more than happy

to do a sketch well I had a couple guys

just draw pictures of me I was standing

there like you want me to draw a picture

yeah drop one of me they look at me like

I'm in the pencil broke anyway they do

we're moving on moving on next thing I

want to talk about this is a dislike or

a diss favorite as we established at the

beginning Japanese companies giving

talks because there were a ton of PACOM

Namco whatever pick a especially game

company and the Japanese guy would be

always a good it was it all used to get

money for like 20 freakin minutes and

then the translator would be like we are

very proud to show you a dead cool

rising 1876 alpha yeah

Oh syndicates are gonna be sick and I so

get it together there will be

multiplayer I think it's a good thing

that and all the shit's on the slide

right behind them I don't need to say

anything you know it's I guess in a way

it's cool to have the creator of Megaman

there yeah until what you have to listen

to just hired somebody to tell me the

things that he won't have him come out

and say hi I'm the creator of Megaman

very happy to be here

this guy's gonna talk guys gonna talk

for me I'm just saying if I was in Japan

I wouldn't talk and the last thing this

was my thing the protest the Westboro

Baptist Church were they're trying to

claim that God hates all the comic-con

attendees because apparently we're all

gay yeah I don't understand why might be

but the rest of the people probably

weren't in vast majority I'm sure they

were gay people there I guarantee

they're really people there just like

they were straight people there but the

best part was the Comic Con attendees

changed a counter-protest and they're

maybe like less than 10 would you agree

baptist people yeah it was a small group

there must have been over a hundred

Comic Con attendees and the best were

the ones that had signs that like

Superman died for our Superman died

person that was a classic sign that was

a classic and I may be gay but I do love

Commander data just it didn't even make

sense but it's like alright dude

whatever that's it for us about Comic

Con check out our other videos out there

all over there here oh we're definitely

covering Adams face right now oh [ __ ]
