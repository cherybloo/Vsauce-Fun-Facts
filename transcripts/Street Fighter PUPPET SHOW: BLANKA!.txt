no

you shut up

oh hello

i'm adam mclaughlin from wacky gamer

i'm gonna be sick

did you know that i have an online

puppet show called animal trash that you

can watch on youtube

it's true

we even made a video for vsauce

but don't take my word for it check it

out won't you

check it out won't you

when i think of disgusting red-headed

monsters with skin conditions the first

person i think of is danny bonaducci

then i think of the ginger topped beast

no not carrot top blanca from street

fighter first and foremost i do want to

address the beast comment i mean really

blanca is so ugly he's like the

red-headed stepson of the fighting

universe i wonder what it was like for

him growing up

of course i was picked on in high school

i look like an incredible hulk mark

maguire i've heard all the insults

prehistoric carrot top

fire booger of guatemala

child molester pokemon

zombie carrot cake

i've heard them all that's the kind of

childhood trauma you never recover from

do you think it's been easy for blanca

it's one i went to rehab

usually when a monster's as ugly as

blanca they have some kind of super

power that makes up for their appearance

like the incredible hulk's strength all

blanca has is some really unreliable

static electricity does anyone have a

lie wait wait wait i got it hold on

damn it no my b button stuck

and to add insult to injury the only way

to use blanca's lightning attack is to

let your opponent get close enough to

punch you in the face

this is my life

despite his numerous shortcomings i find

myself really liking blanca and whenever

i play him i can't help but wonder

what's he going to do after street

fighter where will i go after super

street fighter 4

arby's i'm gonna be sick hadouken
