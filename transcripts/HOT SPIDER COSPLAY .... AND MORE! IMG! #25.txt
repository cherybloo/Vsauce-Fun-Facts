pants and a boy in love wait

better than sniffing hippo but except a

jar full of kiddy put things in front of

your face to get a kiss or a fish face

or just dress up in Spidey costumes you

can do it outside in bars in hotel rooms

but if you want to see a real spider

female here you go

BuzzFeed collected cats with mustaches

some are hipster some are head to ler

and some are man-made but what really

matters is women with mustaches enjoy

he poses in them a lot but he's

following in excellent footsteps

too cute here's a perspective illusion

LA it's a random assortment of stars

that looks like gobbledygook except from

one angle the angle that Earth has at

its side this microwave is very happy

brain cube the only thing more puzzling

is Justin Bieber's underwear ad but a
