he's awesome hello I'm coming to you

today from Los Angeles I went to the

Griffith Observatory today and

everything was so green and verdant I

decided instead of doing video game WTF

let's do some real life WTF I pulled

together some of the grossest facts I

could find in this book 1001 facts that

will scare the [ __ ] out of you and I

loved a bunch of my l8 that you make her

friends with the facts and you try to

make them puke let's see if it worked

alright Todd thank you very much for

recording this one's really important

did you know that while you walk around

during the day like that just don't move

alright here's the deal

during the day while you walk around and

move your body's own weight compresses

your joints ligaments and tendons so

that by the time you go to bed at night

you are 8 millimeters shorter than you

are when you wake up in the morning

fresh and expanded it makes me wonder if

you're in space without the gravity to

compress you back down how tall would

you grow to be would you just continue

to grow yeah I think you just keep

growing Neil Armstrong actually by the

time I got back from moon was 20 feet

tall and that's a fact

Vsauce doesn't lie so I'm looking at

these crazy cutaneous horns I don't know

if you've heard about rush see humans

humans can actually grow a horn that

looks like a devil horn in the topic

what's it made out of it's made out of

like your fingernail it's really away

yeah they don't know what causes it but

they guess that maybe exposure to

radiation that's why I guess the only

thing doctors have really concluded is

that they make me horny

I'm the director so just say what you're

gonna say Tom thank you for filming

goodbye please I'll be the director

today okay then here I'll do my

impression of you oh you're gonna throw

a tantrum maybe saw some of these images

at Chinese food guess what they're not

images at all it's a map of seafood

restaurants Oh a cat fighting a warrior

crazy subscribe guys let's stop joking

around and talk about the u.s. in the

year 2000 obstetrician Alan zarkan in

New York City performed a c-section on a

woman when she was giving birth and he

thought he did such a good job but he

actually carved his initials AZ into her

belly I mean I thought everybody did

that I mean oh when I was circumcised

I've been initials from circumsized oh

oh well I know that was like a time you

can pay extra for that if you want

what's up L what's up michael michael

from vsauce here to tell you that if you

wear a ring there can be more germs

underneath it than the population of

Europe that is disgusting

that's why I'm not wearing a ring today

but you know what I was wearing mark

speedos from yesterday's Key of Awesome

blades damnit sorry Michael did you know

that our stomach acids can dissolve a

razor blade in less than a week I did

not know that you want to try one let's

try one all right check back with us in

10 days up can I get some salt Oh hmm

I'm here with star from the wing girls

she gives out great dating advice and

star did you know that in your lifetime

your salivary glands will produce enough

spit to fill two Olympic sized swimming

pools wow I did not know that that is

who spit you know I created this whole

sexy to tie that's why the pool is so

warm and so slippery okay Wow I mean I

can think of so many times where I've

been kissing a guy and the one thing I

think it's like man if there's only more

saliva right now I'd be so happy this is

Andre for black nerd comedy and I am

forcing him to stare into the Sun

because this fact is a doozy there are

six point seven billion people in the

world and mathematicians have calculated

it based on that at any given second

there are 4000 people doing it right now

and here's another fact it will never be

me if the four thousand people that is

so sad you deserve some shade at there

ah so there you go those are a bunch of

gross facts but let me know in the

comments below what is the grossest

thing you have ever seen for me my

roommate back in college boiled up a

bunch of octopi and sort of forgot it on

the stove for weeks and I had to then

clean out a rotten fungus filled

tentacle pot it was great but let me

know below if you can top that what's

the grossest thing you've ever seen and

hey as always thanks for watching
