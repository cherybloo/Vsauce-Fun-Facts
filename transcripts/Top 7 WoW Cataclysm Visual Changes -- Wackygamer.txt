hey guys Jeff here from wacky gamer I

wanted to bring you the top 7 things

I've seen in the latest World of

Warcraft Cataclysm footage they finally

filled in Thunder Ridge outside of

Orgrimmar I don't know what Blizzard was

thinking but it's like let's put an area

in the new zone where you could fall to

your death and get your ass kicked by

thunder Coto trying to get out

yay no wrong no longer they added flight

points to stranglethorn Vale no more

running up and down just to empty your

bags for the Alliance because it made

the Alliance feel like the redheaded

stepchild of the factions the goblin

barge and Thousand Needles looks awesome

you know it's everything you would

expect it to be gritty there's gears

everywhere sort of looks like it was

built out of the spare parts from the

customer car my dad never finished

building man he really loved that 94

Fiat Punto no idea why

Westphal really needed something to

break up all that big boring yellow

nothingness it has the giant crater is a

nice addition that maelstrom in the

middle don't know exactly what it is is

it like a giant hurricane a magical

vortex result of a dragon fart who knows

but all I do know is really awesome and

you shouldn't cast any fire lightning

spells nearby I don't know if you've

seen a dragon fart explode but it ain't

pretty

they made Orgrimmar grittier which is

awesome with all the construction

equipment in the dark coloring scheme

one major complaint people had was it

wasn't hardcore enough they really

needed the city to be an icon that could

justify the Mealing fall to hold online

for Toy Story Mania at Disneyland during

Blizzcon know for the Alliance

was though Abba Lyons in the house you

there is grass and desolace now big big

news a lot of people you're sitting

going who cares I do is hopefully now

when I level a character through there

the coda won't shake my damn camera like

it always used to and finally the worgen

male dance there's one thing World of

Warcraft needed it was Justin Timberlake

and now I can get my Timberlake on

actually I gotta go I'm gonna go

watching Dance Central videos

you
