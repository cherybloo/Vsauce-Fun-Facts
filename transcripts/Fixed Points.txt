hey Vsauce Michael here there is an art

museum on the moon

supposedly we can't be sure until we go

back and check but as the story goes in

1969 Fred wall Tower from Bell

Laboratories and sculptor Forrest Myers

convinced an engineer working on the

Apollo 12 lunar lander to hide a

itsy-bitsy roughly 2 by 1 centimeter

ceramic tile within the gold blankets

wrapped around parts of the spacecraft

that would be left on the moon and

etched onto that ship or artworks by

famous artists according to everyone

involved the plan worked and when the

Apollo 12 team left the moon the wafer

was still there now two days later Myers

told the New York Times what they had

done and this image of the wafer was

published it contains a rauschenberg

straight line a Oldenburg drawing of

Mickey Mouse pretty cool and the story

is likely to be true if confirmed that

would make this wafer the first and

currently only art museum on the moon

but the thumb is covering something in

fact it's covering Andy Warhol's

submission

why well according to Warhol all he did

was innocently etch his initials on the

chip he stylized them like this

he drew a somewhat funny W for Warhol

and then put a line right across here to

make this bit look like an a that's it

it's just his initials here's an

unobscured view of a replica that's on

the moon right now I however am on earth

right now in North America and this is a

map of North America which is cool

because if you are in the place you have

a map of well mathematically there will

always be some point on your map that is

directly above the place in the real

world it represents always it doesn't

matter how you hold the map it can be

rotated flipped even twisted folded or

crumbled it is guaranteed by brower's

fixed point theorem a fixed point is

anything that goes nowhere

after a transformation Brouwer's theorem

tells us that it is impossible to

completely mix up a set of points if

they are bounded without holes and

transformed continuously with no cutting

or gluing without bounds every point can

be mapped somewhere new around holes

every point can be mapped somewhere new

and if you cut or glue every point can

be mapped somewhere new but otherwise

mixing will always fail somewhere a

transformation is continuous if as the

distance between any two points reaches

zero in the before state it also

approaches zero in the after State

each square of this checkerboard is

filled with point like pixels of a

unique color as we transform it

let's have pixels still within the

square they began in glow okay as you

can see no matter how you resize or

manipulate the checkerboard it will

always glow somewhere you cannot get

every pixel to be simultaneously outside

of its original square unless you cut or

move the whole shape outside of the

space that used to fill here's a

question do you think you can completely

mix up coffee in a mug by stirring well

of course you can not stirring coffee is

a continuous transformation of the

coffee and everything stays within the

same space so brower's fixed-point

theorem applies no matter how well you

try to stir there will always be after

the liquid has settled at least one

point that you stirred right back to

where it was before a fixed point to be

sure coffee isn't made out of points

it's made out of molecules but they're

quite tiny and very numerous so within a

degree of error it'll pretty much hold

fixed points

don't just frustrate your ability to

fully mix things they can also suck you

toward them they can be attractive like

the number nine try this think of a

number with more than one digit and then

add up its digits now subtract that sum

from the original number to get a new

number if you do this over and over and

over again until you're left with a

single-digit number you will always end

up with nine

every time also notice that any number

with two or more digits minus the sum of

its digits becomes divisible by nine

right away what's going on here well

there's nothing mystical about nine misc

in general instead it's just a

consequence of how we write numbers

numbers can be written in all sorts of

ways but the most common base ten

positional notation makes the nine trick

work

in this system a number like twenty five

doesn't mean two and five

it means ten twos and one five that's

twenty-five so subtracting out just the

positional digits of a number removes

one member from each group the digit you

have one of completely disappears the

digit you have ten of goes down to nine

copies the digit you have 100 of goes

down to 99 copies and so on so the whole

thing becomes a multiple of nine

attractive fixed points also play a

starring role in a famous method for

calculating square roots it's called the

babylonian method the number you want to

find the square root of is called the

radicand and it's square root is some

number that is equal to the radicand

divided by itself okay now step one of

this method is guess if your guess is

lower than the actual answer the

radicand divided by your guests will be

larger than the answer and vice-versa

the true answer will always be somewhere

in between those two values so after you

guess take both values and find their

average it'll be a point in between and

now use this value as your guests and

keep going

you will converge towards the true

square root at a pretty nice speed the

number of correct digits in your

approximation will roughly double after

every iteration

that's pretty cool but let's talk about

infinity specifically Aleph numbers they

describe sizes of well ordered

infinities the smallest is aleph-null

equal to the quantity of integers that

there are but there are literally larger

infinities than that in order of

increasing size they are Aleph 1 a love

- Aleph 3 and so on each one is infinite

but refers to a greater number of things

than the infinity before if you tried to

pair up aleph-null things with Aleph 1

things you'd literally run out of

aleph-null things first even though it's

endless you can hear more about Aleph

numbers in this video of mine but here's

the thing there happens to be an Aleph

fixed point notice that the subscript of

each Aleph is equal to the number of

infinities less than it there are none

less than Aleph null one less than Aleph

1 2 less than a love 2 and so on each

next Aleph number is monstrously bigger

than the last but only adds one to the

growing list of Olives clearly these

rates are so different they'll never

meet up but they do take a look at this

number Aleph Aleph Aleph alfalfa a load

rule and so on an endless cascade of

Olives

how many infinities are smaller than

this number well look at its subscript

it's well it's an endless cascade of a

lafe's just like the number itself this

is an Aleph fixed point and infinity so

large it is equal to the number of

infinities smaller than itself

that's cool but probably my favorite

fixed point related thing is the force

of Coulomb theorem

it states that at any given moment there

must be at least one pair of points on

Earth's surface that are diametrically

opposite one another but nonetheless

have the same temperature and

atmospheric pressure diametrically

opposite points on a sphere are called

Antipodes and as I've discussed before

if you place a piece of bread on the

ground somewhere on earth and another

one on that points antipode well you've

made yourself an earth sandwich there

are sites that help you locate such

opposite points on land but at this

moment in history you'll notice that

most points on land are antipodal to

water which makes sense the Earth's

surface is mainly covered with water but

even though we know that we don't always

appreciate just how gigantic the Pacific

Ocean is maybe because maps tend to cut

right along at dividing its power but

take a look at this this is the Atlantic

Ocean all right this is the Pacific

Ocean it's really more of a water

hemisphere the Pacific Ocean is so large

in fact it contains its own Antipodes

meaning there are places in the Pacific

Ocean where you could float and know

that even if you dug a hole straight

down through the center of the earth and

emerged on the other side you would

still be in the Pacific Ocean ok anyway

back to borsa Coulomb to see how it

works let's imagine two thermometers on

opposite sides of the earth a and B the

temperatures they record will probably

be different but if we swap their

locations always keeping them at all

times on opposite sides of the planet

their temperature readings will just

flip in order to swap well the readings

are going to have to cross at least once

no matter how we swap these always and

typical thermometers a crisscross will

have to

happen at least one somewhere moreover

these fixed points aren't just peppered

around the globe willy-nilly

a continuous unbroken band of them must

separate A's region from bees why well

because if there wasn't such a wall that

would mean there'd be a way to swap them

without their readings having to ever

meet which we know can't happen okay

next let's pick a pair of antipodal

points on this band and measure

atmospheric pressure at both if they're

the same hey that's pretty good

our job is done but if they're not we

can just swap the barometers along the

band like with temperature the pressures

they measure swap so somewhere they will

have to have the same value even though

weather is chaotic and always changing

and even though the other side of the

world is very very far away there must

always be at least two places on

opposite ends of the earth where the

temperature and the pressure are the

same this is true by the way for any two

variables that vary continuously across

Earth's surface for is often called a

cosmic number why well because try this

name any number in English really any at

all positive negative rational complex

uninteresting surreal infinite doesn't

matter now count the number of letters

in its name this gives you a new number

count the number of letters in its name

and keep going eventually every time

every single time you will wind up at

four where you will be stuck looping

forever side note if doing something

over and over again doesn't produce a

different result than just doing it once

the procedure is called ident

meaning same power taking the absolute

value of a number is an ID impotent Act

doing it once or doing it a million

times gives the same result

pushing an elevator call button is

identity' new on spill come to you

pushing it again and again and again and

again

doesn't make it arrive faster or

differently anyway we get stuck at four

because it's the only number in the

English language spelled with the same

number of letters as the quantity it

represents about four years ago

reddit user protocol seven showed that

there are no other endless loops except

for and that while negative 15 and

negative 17 both contain their absolute

value worth of letters which makes them

special to be sure they obviously aren't

spelled with a negative number of

letters for is for JUnit there's no

escape a path to it is forced Oh Fork

it's even on my forearm well I look

forward to seeing you again soon

and as always thanks for watching

[Music]

I have some exciting news if you are a
