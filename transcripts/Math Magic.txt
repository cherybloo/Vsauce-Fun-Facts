hey Vsauce Michael here if you rearrange

the letters in William Shakespeare

you can spell here was I like a song in

the King James Bible in psalm 46 the

46th word is shake and the 46th word

from the bottom is sphere William

Shakespeare was 46 years old when the

King James Bible was completed is this

just a coincidence yes it is

given enough searching enough words

enough data you can eventually find and

should indeed expect all kinds of neat

coincidences it's just probability

here's another good example think of a

card any card value and suit okay got it

mentally focus on that card deliver it

to my brain using ESP whoa I got it

here it is amazing right now think of

another card are you ready okay it's

some well it's this one right one more

time

think of a card really think about it

and there it is impressed

probably not but approximately seven of

you might be easy there are only 52

cards if each card is equally likely to

be thought of I had a one in 52 chance

of guessing your card and about a 1 in

every 140,000 chance of doing so three

times in a row if say a million people

watched this video and play along after

three tries you could expect about seven

people to be left who had their imagined

card pulled by mean each time

except not more than seven actually

you see there's even more magic

happening here and by magic

I mean math when asked to arbitrarily

think of a card studies have shown that

people tend to think of certain cards

more often than others these are the

results from a study of a few hundred

people hearts are named a bit more often

than the other suits the three cards I

drew are the top three most often

thought of but would it be more amazing

if it actually was magic yes and no

obviously magic as a performance is

important it reminds us that being

stupefied and curious and humbled is fun

without a visceral reaction to the

unknown would we care to learn or study

or investigate but yet explanations

don't dull mystery they empower the

mystified explanations aren't ends

they're in trances the start of an

ability to use reassemble and reimagine

new things out of what you now know

here's a cool fact if you divide a deck

of cards exactly in half there will

always be the same number of red cards

in one half as there are black cards in

the other no matter how mixed up the

cards were before you began

it's not magic though it's just that

think of it this way half of the cards

in a deck are red so all the red cards

could fit in one deck half this means

that the number of cards in a half that

aren't red that is our black cards are

necessarily equal in number to the Reds

that must be in the other half knowing

this you can devise an even neater trick

like the really cool trick Matt Parker

just showed off on his channel which you

should subscribe to or like this one

take an easier to count number of cards

like say 10 and then place another 10

cards on top but face up have a friend

shuffle the whole mess however they wish

cuts

messy cuts riffle smooshing they just

can't cause any card to flip over then

ask them to hand you the pack and behind

your back even while blindfolded show

them that you can separate the deck into

two halves with the same number of

face-up cards every time over and over

again all you have to do is count out

ten cards the number of face-up cards in

one hand will equal the number of

facedown cards in the other flip one of

the packs over and all of its facedown

cards will turn into face-up ones tada

the face-up counts are now equal here's

another trick that shows off some neat

mathematical properties to help me with

this trick I've brought in Vanessa from

the YouTube channel braincraft it's an

awesome Channel please go check it out

but first check out this trick are you

ready I'm ready

we've got ten cards on the table five

diamonds and five clubs ace to five of

each go ahead and put the clubs on top

of the diamonds face up face up yep

alright now I am going to mix these

cards up alright and you were gonna use

your ESP abilities to get the cards

paired up at the end you ready okay I

want to mix these up take some off the

top moving to the bottom taking parts

from the bottom and just like I don't

okay I'm gonna I'm gonna cut these as

well let me know where you want to cut

them okay yeah there okay we'll cut the

cards there and I'm gonna take half of

what's here five cards and deal them

down one two three four five I'm gonna

set the other five right there now we

have two piles and it is your turn to

start swapping we got poor swaps you can

make and a swap involves taking the top

card and moving it to the bottom okay

alright now you can divvy up these four

swaps however you want you can do four

here you can do 2 & 2 1 & 3 whatever you

want okay I'll do three here

yeah interesting yeah right you do it

I'll do it one two three and then one

swap here good yes now we're left with

these two cards on top I'm gonna take

them off and set them right here now

three swaps all three okay it's your

choice

one two three and the top two cards I

will peel off and we'll set aside all

right now two swaps two here mm-hmm all

right one two once again the cards that

are on top get peeled off and set aside

one swap one here okay so I'll take

these away and we're left with two cards

will they be the same will they be a

match let's find out okay

whoa don't say okay yet because things

aren't okay if something magic just

happened we've got all of these cards we

set aside and yet they're all matches

both aces right there what are these

both fives you also matched up the

threes and of course the fours you're

welcome

thank you very much but not you Vanessa

you mathematics every time no matter how

your friend decided to swap matching

pairs will be together how well it's all

about cycles if you have some cards in a

particular order and you cut them

somewhere doesn't matter waiter you will

only change the positions of the

individual cards but not the sequence

the next card down will always be the

next card in order with the whole thing

wrapping back around it helps to think

of the order not as a tower but as a

clock now when the trick we just did

each cards match is always just five

cards away in the sequence

because five happens to also be the

number of cards in half the pack

dividing the pack in half leaves pairs

lined up no matter how we've cut the

deck in the trick however we added a bit

of extra confusion by dealing the top

half down onto the table one two three

four five this has the effect of

reversing its order now instead of

having the same position in each package

pairs have mirrored positions the number

of cards below any given card in the

bottom pack is the number above it in

the top pack this balance means that

swapping all the cards above a target in

the bottom pack leaves it on top and

swapping the number of cards below it

from the other pack leaves its match on

the other top of course the number of

cards above and below a target card in

the bottom pack is just the number of

all the other cards in that half which

is the total amount in each pack minus

one that's why with five cards in each

pack we started with four swaps then

after each pack had shrunk to four we

did three swaps as long as the total

number of swaps adds up to the pack

total minus 1

we'll have matching pairs on top you can

extend these facts about cyclical

sequences to other tricks of your own

imagining this is one of my favorite

tricks it comes from Peter Magowan on

the stem maths magic channel trick time

once again I'm joined by Vanessa from

brain craft and ace through five of

diamonds and ace through five of clubs

Vanessa could you please take the ACE

through five of diamonds and put them on

top of the clubs but flip them over so

they're facedown okay so we now have a

kind of messy little deck here where all

the black cards are face up and the Reds

are face down we're gonna mix these up a

lot we can even riffle shuffle this

riffle shuffle right kind of divide it

in half like this and then well it's

hard to do with a few cards and they do

a little you know yeah thank you

where would you like me to cut these

right there okay cool now there's

another way you can kind of mix up a

deal cards it's called the down over

deal goes like this one card goes down

the next goes over one goes down one

goes over down over down over down over

until you're done okay but now it's your

turn all right I'm gonna go two at a

time and you're gonna tell me whether

these first two cards should be dealt

down or should be turned over okay

down down what about these down down

over down over all right now let's go

four at a time

okay one two three four should these go

down or over over what about these four

down death and the final two now we can

do this as long as as often as you want

I can keep doing this we can do - we can

do four at a time how do you feel

let's do it once more and do two at a

time two time okay

down down down

down you're getting faster buff down

okay all right now I'm going to make two

little piles like a little book all

right one okay

now Vanessa should I close this book

like this or like this all right there

we go now you had completely free choice

here mm-hmm you made a lot of different

decisions somewhat arbitrarily but yet

like oil and water

the black and the red cards have

separated and only the Reds have face-up

I knew this would happen but it's not

because of magic it's because of math

here's how it works the red cards all

start out facedown the black cards

face-up no amount of cutting or rippling

will change the fact that Reds are

facedown and blacks are face-up but when

you down over Deal you cause every other

card to have its original facing

direction reversed down over down over

down over down over down over this

alternating sequence is maintained

through any number of cuts because it's

cyclical this is the key to the trick

because when we alternatively deal cards

into book halves one pile will contain

cards reversed by the down over deal the

other cards not reversed

depending on how you close the book

either all reversed carts are

unrehearsed or all unrehearsed cards are

reversed

either way the original division by

color comes back the swaps missed things

up by introducing an illusion of control

but in reality the swaps are what are

known as a hummer deal a swap flips the

facing direction of the cards you flip

but simultaneously moves them to the

correct category preserving the sequence

as long as you swap an even number of

cards the facing direction of all of

them is reversed but the positions they

wind up in are still correct

according to the sequence finally let's

end with something popular that also

sounds cool on the surface until you go

deeper understand it better and it winds

up being well even cooler the number of

different ways 52 cards can be arranged

there's obviously a lot the top card

could be any card

so there's 52 different possibilities

any remaining cards can follow so there

are 51 possibilities for the next card

54 the third spot 49 for the fourth and

so on multiplying all of these numbers

together gives us how many unique ways

fifty-two cards can be arranged 52

factorial is a gigantic amount so large

in fact every time you shuffle a deck of

cards

well smoosh it for a few minutes or

riffle at seven or more times

chances are you have put those playing

cards into an order that they have never

been in in the entire history of cards

or humans or the universe seriously this

is because 52 factorial is eight point

zero six five eight times ten to the

67th in comparison the observable

universe is only about 10 to the 18th

seconds old even if you had been

properly shuffling a deck every single

second since the universe began 13.7

billion years ago you still to this day

wouldn't have even come close to

assembling every arrangement possible

but even that doesn't paint the whole

picture of just how big 52 factorial is

scotch appeal wrote what in my opinion

are some of the most mind-boggling

visualizations of the size of 52

factorial imagine setting a timer to

count down 52 factorial seconds while

the timer runs stand on the equator and

wait one billion years

after a billion years have passed take a

single step forward and then wait

another billion years before taking a

second step and so on

once you have walked all the way around

the earth take a single drop of water

out of the Pacific Ocean that's five

hundredths of a milliliter and set it

aside now continue walking at a rate of

one step every billion years removing

one drop after every journey around the

entire Earth and by the time the Pacific

Ocean is completely empty

put a single sheet of paper on the

ground refill the ocean and keep going

until the stack of paper reaches the Sun

at that point how many seconds will be

left on the timer will it be zero a few

hundred a few billion no there will

still be eight times ten to the sixty

seven seconds left you have barely made

a dent if you start all over again and

do that whole thing a thousand more

times you will only be 1/3 of the way

done

luckily Scott has a great idea for how

to pass the rest of the time if you're

bored of paper and water and walking

instead he says deal yourself five cards

every billion years when you finally

deal yourself a royal flush buy a

lottery ticket if the ticket wins the

lottery throw a single grain of sand

into the Grand Canyon as soon as the

Grand Canyon is completely full of sand

remove one ounce of rock that's about 28

grams from Mount Everest

by the time Mount Everest is leveled

take a look at the clock this is what

will be left

do the whole Royal Flush lottery ticket

Grand Canyon Mount Everest thing 256

more times and then and only then will

your timer have reached zero that is how

big 52 factorial is it's pretty big but

now think about this the number of

possible people the number of different

humans there could be is well even

larger what that means is that even

though you will probably die most people

including possibly the smartest or

funniest or most annoying possible

person won't even get to die like you do

they won't even get to be born so I'm

glad you were and as always thanks for

watching
