hey Vsauce Michael here and today we are

going to talk about why we dream what's

going on inside our brains the

scientific study of dreaming is called

Anaya ology and for most of history it

didn't really exist because you can't

hold a dream it's difficult to measure a

dream you can't taste it you can't see

other people's dreams and if you ask

them to tell you what they dreamt the

results are almost always unreliable in

fact it's estimated that we forget 95%

of the dreams we have especially within

the first 10 minutes of having them but

then in 1952 something amazing happened

researchers at the University of Chicago

found this it's a unique type of

electrical activity that occurs during a

certain stage of a person's sleeping

when researchers awoke people during

this stage they almost always reported

that they had been dreaming also at the

same time during this stage people's

eyeballs are going crazy rapidly darting

all over the place underneath their

eyelids you can actually see this

happening if you watch people sleep like

I usually do during REM sleep some

pretty bizarre stuff happens if you look

at the electrical activity of a brain

that is in REM sleep that almost exactly

mimics the way the brain acts when it's

awake

the biggest difference being that the

production of chemicals inside the brain

like norepinephrine serotonin and

histamine is almost completely blocked

and that causes the muscles to stop

moving which is why you can dream about

flying or running around or fighting

ninjas but your body doesn't move people

who have a disorder achieving complete

REM a topia move around in their sleep

and act out their dreams they can even

get out of bed and sleepwalk oh before

you move forward I should say two things

one is that it's possible to wake up and

not be able to move your body because

you're still in rem a topia you're

completely conscious and you know that

you're awake but your body is not ready

to move on the flipside you can also be

inside a dream and know that you're

dreaming this phenomenon is known as

lucid dreaming and it's particularly

attractive because while I'm in a lucid

dream I can

conscious decisions about what I do I

can go fly to wherever I want or I can

have a tea party with Abraham Lincoln

I'm in control but achieving a lucid

dream is quite elusive Howcast has a

great video which I've put in the

description that gives some tips and

tricks on how to achieve one researchers

were able to deprive mice of REM sleep

by using this inverted inside a tub of

water way up to the tippy top meaning

that the mouse was only able to sit

right on top of this little tiny surface

when that happens the mouse can still

fall into non REM sleep but as soon as

they reach REM sleep and their muscles

relaxed they fall off the platform into

the water waking up what they found was

that when mice are not allowed to

achieve REM sleep they have an

incredible amount of trouble remembering

things

this happens in humans too if you have

people remember word pairs and then you

don't allow them to sleep the next day

their memory for that stuff is

incredibly terrible but memory and REM

does not stop there if a person learns a

difficult new task during the day say a

new instrument or a new type of

difficult puzzle you can measure the

electrical activity in their brain while

they do that and then while they sleep

that night whether they know it or not

their brain replays those electronic

impulses many popular theories about why

we dream are variations on the idea that

while we sleep the unconscious part of

our brain is busy organizing memories

and strengthening connections from the

day before that we need in the future

while getting rid of the junk that would

otherwise clog the brain now so the

theory goes these electrical impulses

are detected by our conscious brain and

our cortex freaks out and doesn't know

what it means and so it tries it's best

to create a cohesive story creating a

dream this would explain why dreams are

often so fantastic and seemingly random

they're not supposed to make sense

they're not an actual message from our

brain it's just the results of our

cortex is trying to synthesize the noise

coming from all the work being done back

in the unconscious under this way of

thinking dreams are an epiphenomena

they're not a primary process that has a

purpose instead they're the accidental

result of a more important process

is going on behind the conscious brain

but some researchers don't believe that

they believe the dreams serve a primary

purpose and that purpose is to prepare

us for threats they think this because

the most prevalent emotions felt during

dreams are negative abandonment anger

and the most common of all anxiety the

theory goes like this back when we were

early humans especially we had no idea

what kind of threats we might encounter

during the day and so to prepare us our

brain would simulate anxieties while we

slept to make us better prepared for

that feeling in the real world so people

who had terrifying dreams were better at

dealing with anxiety in the real world

and had stronger genes

all right so the theories we discussed

today are quite popular but they don't

really enjoy a consensus not everyone

agrees on them and they barely scratched

the surface of scientific thought about

dreams but that's kind of the cool thing

about dreams think of it like this

here is the Eagle Nebula a giant

structure in outer space 6,500 light

years away but despite its distance we

pretty much know what it's made out of

we know that it's a hundred trillion

kilometres tall we know what caused it

and we know where it's gonna be in 750

million years but last night I had

dreams and no one really knows why or

for what reason and that's pretty cool

and that's why thanks for watching

if you want to learn more about the

world I highly recommend smarter every

day it's a show here on YouTube by a guy

named Destin who I've met he's awesome

I've learned a lot from him he's the guy

who did the chicken thing from the

Leanback

he's also studied what causes poop

splash slow motion water balloons and

has a lot of guns and explosions what

more could you ask for so do me a favor

and go check it out and subscribe if you

like it and if you haven't seen it yet

go check out what's what's review of my

beard I've got that in the description

and as always thanks for watching
