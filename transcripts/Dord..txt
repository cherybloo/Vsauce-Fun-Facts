Hey, Vsauce. Michael here

In 1934 Webster's dictionary gave birth to a new word

by mistake. Their chemistry editor

Austin N Paterson submitted a simple entry: "D 

or D abbreviation for density".

Nothing wrong with that, but the entry was misread

and 'dord' was added to the dictionary.

'Dord' was an accidental word for
thirteen years before the mistake was

discovered

and its wordship revoked. Let's have fun
with words today,

but first, what's the deal with first?

Or for that matter, second? If you were in
position three

you're in third place. Position 5, fifth.

Position 197

one hundred and ninety-seventh. Pretty simple.

So why do positions 1 and 2 give us first and second?

Shouldn't they be 'oneth' and 'twoth'?

Well, maybe. But English loves

collateral adjectives. Adjectives derived
from different roots than the nouns

they describe. There are plenty of
derived adjectives, don't get me wrong.

A bunch of clouds

make the day cloudy, friends are friendly,

poets are poetic. Things with a lot of
smell to them are smelly

but the Moon is not Moonly.

The Moon is lunar.

Collateral adjectives are everywhere.

Mouth stuff is oral. Bees are apian.

Some nouns have both. Fathers can be

fatherly or paternal .

And a setting filled with fog can be foggy or brumous.

It's often said that no word

rhymes with orange. Is that true?

Well, rhyming can be controversial because
it often depends on pronunciation,

accent and can be forced. Especially if
you use multiple

words, you can force orange to rhyme with
door hinge,

if you want. But what we want is a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme is what occurs between
two words

like tickle and pickle. They are perfect
rhymes because the final stressed

vowel sound and all the sounds
afterwards are identical.

Identical doesn't rhyme with pickle,
because even though they both

end with 'ickle', identical has it stress
in the wrong place.

We could rhyme them if we pronounced it
not identical

but instead identical. With that in mind,

orange does have perfect rhymes. They
just happen to be extremely obscure,

like 'Blorenge', a hill in Wales.

Silver also has a perfect rhyme: chilver, a female lamb.

Think Fact delineated even more words we
often say don't have rhymes but

actually do. Point is, orange does have

perfect rhymes, and even if it didn't, well,

that wouldn't make it special. Sure, monosyllabic words

tend to rhyme with other words. It's believed
there are only about 100 single syllable

words that have no rhyme.

For instance, wolf, sixth, depth and filmed.

But considering words of all lengths,

it's been calculated that most English words

don't rhyme with anything. Don't believe me?

Well, leave a comment below. The word
'comment'

rhymes with nothing, nor does husband, sandwich,

liquid, penguin, chimney, empty,

and, of course, 'nothing' rhymes with nothing.

Identical rhymes are even more perfect

than perfect rhymes but they become so
identical at that point

it's a little obvious and not really
appreciated.

Identical rhymes occur when the consonant
sound before the final stressed vowel

between two words are also identical.

Sun and gun are perfect rhymes. But gun

and begun are identical rhymes. So are

offend and defend, or homonyms like

son and sun. You could call the people
who watch over, and monitor, the police

'the police police'. Who watches over them? Well,

'the police police police', of course. You can
string together

any number of police's and always create
a sensible,

though clunky, title. You can even use

the word police by itself to create a
grammatical sentence. It takes

eight of them. Police police police police police police police

police. Here's what the sentence
means. Police police,

which police police police watch over,
police police.

Add any multiple of three more police to
this stream

and you preserve the grammar. The most
that fit on Twitter

is 20. If you say police enough times
it starts to sound like its not even a

real word.

That is called jamais vu, the reverse of deja vu,

when something familiar all of a sudden
feels new

and novel. I've covered it before but
let's be clear.

If you don't practice obediency to the police

you may wind up in J L. Escape, and you're an SKP.

Letters, whose names said together some
similar to words,

are called Gramograms. You can't hear

a pterodactyl urinate because it's
silent 'p'.

But every letter in the alphabet is
silent sometimes.

And some letters are used more
frequently than other letters

in English words. Scrabble provides more
of those letters and people guess them more

often when playing hangman. Next time you play hangman you can take advantage of this.

People will guess more letters
incorrectly if you choose a short word

that has few different letters. John McLuhan

ran 15 million computer simulations of
hangman

and he found that the most difficult word for
people to guess

is jazz.

Phantonyms aren't ghostly undead words, they're words
that appear to mean one thing but

actually mean something completely different.

Enervate sounds like it means to fill with energy but it actually means to

drain of energy, to weaken.

Noisome appears to mean really noisy but it actually describes something that has an

extremely offensive smell.

In 2005, the New Oxford American Dictionary
published a new word:

esquivalience.

They said it meant the wilful avoidance of
one's official responsibilities.

But it didn't. They made it up

as a copyright trap. If anyone copied
their dictionary

the stealer wouldn't be able to explain
how esquivalience wound up in their dictionary

without admitting that they had copied it. Map makers often insert fake

features for the same purposes. Streets and
towns that only exist

to trap copiers that only exist on paper,

Paper Streets & Paper Towns. The author of
The Trivia encyclopedia even placed a fake fact

in one of his books because he
was certain

that the Trivial Pursuit board game was
taking their questions

from his book. Sure enough, later the
board game included his fake fact

as a real question. Similarly, the esquivalinece trap was used to catch

Dictionary.com.

But here's the thing: authorities don't
tend to respect copyright traps

built out of fake facts.

Facts cannot be copyrighted. They belong to, and can be used by,

all of us. US federal courts have argued that

fake facts presented as real are not
protected, because if they were,

no one could share real true information
without fear

of sharing something protected by copyright. That said,

stylistic decisions like how the facts
are selected or arranged or articulated

can be copyrighted. When the automobile
association was caught mimicking

the stylistic features of ordnance
surveys, they were forced to pay up

twenty million pounds.

You cannot own a fact

and you cannot own a lie you made up, if
everyone believes it.

But you can own how you tell them.

Puns are great, and in 'The Pun Also Rises'

John Pollock relates a fantastic story.
Puns can be traced

all the way back to be epic of Gilgamesh,
where people are warned

of an upcoming giant flood. They are
told that the skies will soon rain

kibtu and kukku. Words that mean

corn and the sound corn makes when
falling on the ground.

But in the story, the words are actually
puns

on words for misery and suffering.

People who got the pun prepared and
saved their own lives,

but those who failed to recognise the pun
perished in the flood,

which means the very oldest pun on record

was literally corny. Is that ironic?

No. Irony is one of the most

debated figures of speech. The Oatmeal[.com]
famously lamented that if anyone refers

to anything as being

ironic, the hip thing to do right now is
to call it out as being not ironic.

Situational irony is what we
tend to mean when we say something is ironic.

The Oatmeal defines it as "when something
happens and a reversal of expectations occurs".

Dig.com's recent article on the
subject uses an even stricter definition,

saying "situational irony is a direct
result of an

action intended to produce the opposite effect".

Their example is really good. If the elevators

at in elevator repair school are out of order,

that's not really situational irony.
Instead,

what would be really ironic is that if the
elevators were out of order because the

experts at the school had done something to them

they believed would make them run forever
and never be

out of order. Alanis Morissette wrote a
song called

'Ironic', whose lyrics contain situations but

famously no situational irony.

People love pointing this out.

"A traffic jam when you're already late."
Not situational irony,

that's just a bummer or a sad
coincidence. Patrick Cassels cleverly

rewrote the song's lyrics to contain
situations that are actually

situationally ironic. For example, a traffic jam

when you're already late to receive an
award from the municipal planning board

for reducing the city's automobile
congestion

eighty percent, or a black fly in your
chardonnay

poured to celebrate the successful fumigation of your recently purchased vineyard in southern France.

Now that's what I call situational irony.

But regardless of what Alanis intended,

a close reading of the song's lyrics
reveals that irony

is occurring, just not the situational
kind it's hip to argue about.

Instead, her song is all about dramatic irony.

When someone is, often hilariously,

unaware of the significance of an event,
while other people are.

Take a look at the lyrics for 'Ironic'.
The situations she describes are never

explicitly labeled

ironic. At the most, they're simply
stories and similes and metaphors for it:

life.

And, she adds later, life is also

ironic. Dramatically ironic. These
things sound like cruddy scenarios, but they

actually figure, they actually make sense.

Ironic is not a list of examples of
situational irony.

Instead, it's a treatise on dramatic irony,

the difference between what life knows we need

and what we think we need.

What's ironic isn't 10,000 spoons when
all you need is at knife. It's the fact that,

as Alanis believes, you have all of
those spoons,

because unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need right now

is only spoons. Or, the last thing you
need right now is a knife.

On the subject of overanalysing pop songs,

analysis of dog mitochondrial DNA
has revealed that

all dogs may be traceable to a localised event.

The species is believed to have resulted
from the domestication of

wolves about 11,000 to 16,000 years ago,

in what is now Southwestern China.

So, Baha Men, to answer your question, it was the Mesolithic Southwestern Chinese

who let the dogs out.

And as always,

thanks for watching
