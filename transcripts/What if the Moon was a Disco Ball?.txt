Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. If we turned

the Moon into a giant disco ball,

day and night would not

be a disco party. Instead of diffusely
reflecting sunlight onto

all of us, a mirror-tiled moon would reflect

specularly. You would be lucky to momentarily

catch a single reflected beam of sunlight.

Now, with the help visuals by Nick from
Yeti Dynamics, who you should subscribe to

immediately, let's see what would occur
if a disco ball moon actually happened.

Here's the Earth with an imaginary
screen behind it, so we can track the

path of reflections

from a disco ball Moon. It's 3,012 mirror
tiles are ten kilometres thick

and between 100 and 150 kilometres

across. And, as you can see, the beams of sunlight they

reflect would only intersect with Earth briefly

and rarely - a few every month or so would
race past at more than 20,000 kilometers a second.

From the surface of Earth, they'd just be
tiny flashes in the sky

0.1 percent as bright as the regular Sun

and would last a fraction of a second.
The Earth, Sun and Moon just

aren't an ideal locations for disco ball effects.

But, if our disco ball moon was closer

and orbited earth not 384,000 kilometers away but

less than 450, as far as the
International Space Station does,

it would be torn apart by gravitational

title forces. Shoot. Also, the Moon doesn't really

rotate from our perspective like a fun disco ball.

It liberates, but it's starting to look
like instead of an awesome lunar party decoration,

a disco ball moon would just be a lunar party pooper.

So, for the sake of investigation, let's
allow this disco ball Moon to not be torn apart

and allow it to spin in the sky. Now we're talking.

Occasionally we would get glittery
reflections of a dimmer image

of the Sun. From the surface of Earth,

this is what we would see.

You know, being able to see

Earth reflected is almost cooler. It's like being

a bacterium on a giant's face who's looking into a mirror.

You can see the giant, but not yourself.

It kinda makes you feel small.

But it would be a great way to take planetary selfies.

So, let's watch a mirror the width of the
Moon orbit as close as the ISS does.

From the surface of Earth, it would look like this.

The strobe lights around the edge, by
the way, are ten kilometres across.

Pretty cool.

Now finally, let's take a look at the
Moon as a rotating disco ball from low orbit.

The Moon is not a disco ball

and likely never will be. It's just

a diffuse source of illumination. But it's

illuminating in a different way to imagine
what would occur

if that actually happened.

Woah.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
