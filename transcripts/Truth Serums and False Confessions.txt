How do you get information

from someone who wants
to keep it from you?

Somewhere locked
inside their brain

could be the truth
about a crime

or the plan
for a terrorist attack

or the password
to a bank account

or nuclear codes.

To get information,

we often resort to violence,

but that often doesn't work

and can cause a person
to close off even more.

But that's not to say
there aren't other ways

of getting people to talk

or even of getting their brains

to talk for them.

In this episode,
I'm going to be injected

with a truth serum.

I'm going to coerce people
into giving false confessions,

and I'm going to try
to hide the truth

from a mind-reading machine.

What's the best way
to get the truth

or detect a lie?

Let's see if anybody
can dig out the secrets

I've got locked up in my head.

[theme music playing]

[siren wailing]

[indistinct radio chatter]

It's a classic scene
in spy movies.

Someone captures someone
they want information from,

they inject them
with truth serum,

and the person spills

all their secrets.

The serum used in almost
all of these movies

is Sodium Pentothal,

which is an actual drug

that inhibits brain activity.

It was first used
as a painkiller,

 but was found to work better
 as an anti-anxiety drug.

 It dulls your thoughts,

 making it harder
 to perform cognitive tasks,

 including the task
 of making up a lie.

The use of truth serums

began in 1915

when Dr. Robert House,
a physician in Texas,

realized that scopolamine,

a drug given to women
during childbirth,

 had the effect
 of getting them to talk

 without reservation.

Another drug, midazolam,

has been used to treat
Iraq War burn victims

who suffer from PTSD.

Midazolam helps reduce
their inhibitions,

allowing them
to talk more freely

about their experiences.

Midazolam is also
one of the drugs used

 in lethal injections,

 including several
 botched executions.

I arranged to be injected
with midazolam

to see if it could make me
spill my guts.

[music playing]

[cars revving]

[Dr. Malek]
This is the midazolam,

the medicine
we are going to use.

This is enough
to put an elephant to sleep.

So we'll have to make it
very, very, very dilute

and then give you
very, very small amount

- of the diluted drug.
- Please, yes.

You will be
comfortable and happy.

It's euphoric.
You will feel very cool.

But I also wanna
keep some secrets.

That is--

it remains
to be determined.

Okay. Michael, um, we'll
introduce you to Dr. Pavlo.

- Hi.
- [Michael] Nice to meet you.

[Dr. Pavlo]
How are you doing?

- Good.
- [Michael] Dr. Pavlo
 is a police psychologist

 and an expert
 in interrogations.

[Dr. Pavlo]
Have you started the drip yet?

[Dr. Malek]
Uh, we would like to start

with the amount
of one, uh, milligram.

[Michael] Dr. Pavlo's objective
 was to get me to admit

 to certain information,

 one, that my sister's name
 is Melissa

 and, two,
 that my job is hosting

Mind Field and Vsauce.

 My objective--
 not to admit the truth.

Are you feeling
more relaxed in your body?

I'm feeling warm
all over.

It's amazing how quickly
this came into effect.

Let me just ask you
a couple of basic questions.

- I love to.
- [Dr. Pavlo] Okay.

Where are you?

- What town? What city?
- Uh, Pasadena.

How old are you?

- Thirty-one.
- Do you have any siblings?

Uh, yeah.

How old
is your sister, Melissa?

[chuckles]

Uh,

That-- That's not her name.

- Um...
- [Dr. Pavlo]
What do you do for a living?

I am
a choreographer by trade.

- Um...
- [Dr. Pavlo]
What might be something

I'm familiar with that you did?

[Michael] Have you heard
of, um, The Lion King?

- Yes.
- On Broadway?

[Dr. Pavlo] I have.

I think he needs
an extra dose.

- Absolutely.
- [laughing]

- That means I got them right.
- [Dr. Pavlo]
You are too sharp.

[Michael] How much
have I had total so far?

[Dr. Malek] Two milligrams.

[Dr. Pavlo]
Question for you.

How do you feel now?

I feel like in order
to feel like this,

I would have had
to have had...

six drinks.

[Dr. Pavlo]
Tell me about Mind Field.

- Mine field?
- [Dr. Pavlo] Yeah.

[music playing]

Mine field?

Uh, they're--
they're terrible.

There are places
that we've got mines

still littered throughout
the, um, the land,

Cambodia, Vietnam.

You know, I think
you misinterpreted my question.

YouTube show Mind Field 
that you host.

Tell me about that.
Scientific?

I am somewhat familiar with it.

- [clears throat]
- Can he get another dose?

Okay. We're just gonna
get you even more relaxed.

Tell me your occupation.

I'm a choreographer.

And siblings?

I have a sibling
in, uh, Colorado.

[Dr. Pavlo]
What's your favorite food?

[Michael] Uh, rotisserie,

uh, Greek doner.

Does your sister Melissa
like that, too?

She'll eat the meat by itself.

[bell dings]

Trying to get Michael to admit

that he has a sister,
Melissa, was no easy feat.

 Luckily,
 he was anesthetized enough

and did admit that
he has a sister, Melissa.

You ever think about being
an uncle or a father yourself?

Do you want children?

Ah, I would love
to have children, yeah.

My-- my wife and I are trying,

but I'm always doing stuff
like this, you know.

- [Dr. Pavlo] Yeah, yeah.
- It's like, "Hey, honey,

do you wanna make
a little, uh, baby?"

And I'm like,

I got to go [sighs]

get interrogated

and pumped
full of midazolam.

Are you gonna
give him anymore?

Yeah, because I--
He's not sedated enough.

[Michael]
I could do another one.

[Dr. Malek] This would probably
the last dose I wanna give him.

[Dr. Pavlo] Yes.
Do most people

at this dose fall asleep?

Oh, yeah.

[yawns]

How you doing, Michael?

Good.

Feeling a little bit
more tired now?

Yeah, heavy.

And who's the president?

President P--
President Trump.

[Dr. Pavlo]
President Trump. Where are we?

What city are we in?

Yo, Pasadena.

Which show do you like
to do more,

 Mind Field or Vsauce?

Which one
do you enjoy more?

[yawns] Vsauce.

[Dr. Pavlo] Vsauce?

- Yeah.
- Why?

Because they can be
whatever I want them to be,

and there's no
executive in control.

By the way, my eyes
were closed, weren't they?

- Uh-huh.
- [Michael] And I didn't realize

that you were still a real
person asking me questions.

I think had it
not have been for the drug,

 there's no way he would
 have admitted anything.

Before, you were pretending

to be a choreographer,
weren't you?

No, it's the drugs,

but I really am
a choreographer.

[Dr. Pavlo]
 After a few minutes,

 he got right back on track.

He's very strong-willed

and really believes
in what he's doing

and was able
to maintain the charade.

Okay. You're done.

How do you feel?

Uh,

I feel ready to drive.

- [laughs]
- Just kidding.

[Michael] While midazolam
 lowered my inhibitions

 and my ability
 to lie consistently,

 truth serums raise
 ethical concerns

 about one's right
 against self-incrimination.

 Furthermore, larger scale
 studies have shown

 that truth serums
 can cause people

 to reconstruct
 and fabricate memories.

So, truth serums
are not very reliable,

but what about the techniques
used by the police?

[music playing]

I'm gonna tear you apart

if you don't give us
some answers.

Michael,
let me take a shot at this.

Look, we're all friends here.

If I was in your shoes,

I'd probably do the same thing.

You're being too easy
on this, scum.

Your fingerprints are
all over the crime scene.

You make me sick.

Michael,
if you get him too scared,

he'll shut down.

We only wanna scare him enough.

That's right.

And after I do that,

he's gonna
give you relief,

and then we'll do that
over and over and over again.

You're gonna be taken on
an emotional roller coaster

that will
deplete the finite
cognitive resources

you'll need to keep
withholding information.

All right.
I confess.

It really does work.

You see, at one moment,
I'm terrified

but then I'm comforted.

The constant shifting
from one emotion to another

fogs my critical thinking
until I might confess to a crime

I didn't even commit.

It's called
the fear-then-relief response.

[siren wailing]

The good cop/bad cop method
of interrogation

evolved out of a psychological
manipulation procedure

called the Reid technique,

developed in the 1950s

and used broadly
by police departments

since the 1970s.

Now, under the Reid technique,

interrogators first assess

whether a suspect
is withholding the truth.

If they think
the suspect is lying,

interrogators then move
to the second stage

in which they seek a confession.

Now, critics
of the Reid technique say

that the first phase
isn't reliable enough,

and that often,

someone who is
completely innocent

makes it to the second stage

where it's assumed
they're guilty

and police begin
seeking a confession.

And they often get it.

But why would anyone
falsely confess?

Well, to find out,
I decided to learn

how to make someone confess

to a crime they didn't commit.

[music playing]

[Michael] Dr. Melissa Russano
 is an expert

 in investigative research,
 including the process

 of interrogation
 and confession.

Tell me about
false confessions

and why people make them.

In a nutshell,
people confess to crimes

that they didn't commit
because they come to believe

that it's in their best interest
to falsely confess,

and that's really
counterintuitive.

Right, because confessing

is the worst thing
to do, right?

Like that's what you need
to avoid at all costs.

Yes, when you're not
in the situation

of being convinced that
it's actually your best option.

But that's kind of
what I wanna do today.

I wanna see how easy it is

to get a false
confession from someone.

How do I do that?

[Dr. Russano] One way
 is minimization techniques.

 You've got
 to get them to believe

that their best option
out of this situation

to make this end
is to confess.

You can say,
"Look, I really think

it's in your
best interest to cooperate."

There are
other techniques as well

- like maximization, right?
 - [Michael] Okay.

 So they have
 to believe that

if they don't confess,
things are gonna be worse,

um, that the punishment
will likely be more severe,

and so their best option
in the moment is to--

is to confess to you.
One other technique

 is befriending them,

 um, where you're
 lulling the suspect

into a false
sense of security
to trust you.

What about making a deal?

So police officers
are not allowed

to, um, make explicit offers
of leniency or a deal.

So you cannot make
any promises,

but you can say,
"Look, I really think

it's in your best interest
to cooperate."

You don't have
to explicitly say something

for the message
to be communicated.

[Michael]
 With Melissa's tools in mind,

 I was ready to try to get
 a false confession.

- [woman] All right.
- [Michael]
 Our subjects answered

 our online ad
 offering participants $75

 to test a new logic exam

for an educational institution.

 They didn't realize
 that the institution was fake

 and the other participants
 taking the test

 were actually actors
 working for us.

[woman] It's a pretty
standard release form.

[Michael] Before the test,
 the participants were required

 to sign a document
 stating that they would be

 under breach of contract
 if they cheated on the test.

When you work
on the individual questions,

it's very important
that you work alone.

Don't talk about
what you're doing,

don't share answers.

Good luck.
See you soon.

[Michael] The subjects didn't
 know that there were several

 hidden cameras around
 and that we were watching

 everything unfold
 from another room.

 During the testing,
the participants and our actors

 did not share information.

 At no time
 did cheating take place.

I'm gonna collect these
and put them in the database,

and I'll be right back
to start the next phase,
okay, guys?

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

[Michael] I wore an earpiece
 so that Melissa could guide me

 during the entire process.

 A few minutes later,
 it was time

 to set up a false accusation.

So, we actually
might have a problem.

Um, I'll need to speak
to each of you separately.

So, James, could you
come with me just outside?

- Sure.
- I'll take these now.

Thank you.
And, um, Nicole,

you can
just wait right here?

- Awesome. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

You got to give them
enough time to plausibly

- be talking to you.
- Believe that
I'm talking to him.

And calling the director.

- Hi, Nicole.
- Hello.

You and James both had

the same wrong answer

for the triangle problem.

It looks to me like
there was information sharing.

Like, you guys spoke
to one another about the answer

- on that problem?
- I didn't-- I didn't do it.

We didn't talk at all
on the individual problems.

I kept my eyes on my paper
because I knew

that would probably
throw off the results.

If I just write out here,
like,

"I admit
that I shared answers."

I don't remember talking
to him at all about,

- like, while we're doing
the individual...
- Okay.

[Michael]
 First I tried to minimize
the consequences of confessing.

I really think
it's in your best interest.

I really think it's
in your best interest

to sign this stating
that you admit

to sharing the information.

I honestly believe
that that is...

But I did not--
Look, I don't know

what's going on here.
I really--
that's-- I don't know.

- I came here to help.
- I understand
what you're saying and...

And I never said,
like, "Hey, there's..."

- Megan...
- Please let me finish,

because I don't appreciate,
like, over-talking and stuff.

[Michael] I think I may have
 come on too aggressively.

 Next, I tried to maximize
 the consequences

 of not confessing.

What we're looking at
is-- is possible

breach of contract here.

If he comes down here,

he's going to be
a lot more upset.

If the director
has to come down here,

he's gonna be
even more upset

and annoyed
than he already is.

- It did not happen.
- [Michael] Okay.

And I-- my--
I put that on my dad,

and I have my dad
around my neck, so...

[Michael] Some people
 were just too strong-willed.

 Finally, I tried
 to befriend the suspect.

I also understand

you're a nice guy
and, like, sharing information

or helping someone
with a problem

is the nice thing to do.

It's what we normally do.

But I didn't share
any information,

so I can't sign
that document.

[Michael] But this guy
 didn't want to be my friend.

 I struck out with all
 of these test subjects.

 But after these
 failed attempts,

 I was ready to put
 everything I had learned

 into the next encounter.

Is there a strategy
I should use?

I think that
you should proceed

with making sure that you're
not overly confrontational.

- Yeah.
- And making sure that she

sees you as someone
who she can trust
your advice,

and so I would--
I would proceed

with that kind of approach.

Okay. I'm going in.

Thanks for waiting.

- No problem.
- So...

I think we do have a problem.

I was looking through
your individual questionnaires.

- [Deja] Mm-hmm.
- And you guys both had

the same wrong answer

on the triangle problem.

- Really?
- So, it was kind of

this weird, like,
okay, what's going on?

Like, statistically,
what are the chances

that two people are gonna have

these very unique answers?

[Deja] Mm-hmm.

So, I called
the project director

to see what to do
because if, you know,

this is a sign
that information were shared

during the individual section,

that's a major problem
for the study, right?

We didn't look
at each other's stuff.

That was like--
We were, like, on--

Like, we didn't ask
each other anything,

we didn't,
like, you know...

We didn't talk to each other
the whole entire time.

So I don't know how
we got the same answer.

But I'm, like, a hundred
percent sure that that was,

like, the answer
that I came up with.

[Michael] Deja was resolute
 about her innocence,

 so I changed tactics and
 told her what the consequences

 of sharing information
 could be.

And that's a really big deal
because through this grant,

we need to have
integrity of the data,

we need to always obey
the rules of the experiment,

and it could even be
a breach of the contract

that you guys signed
when you came to do this study.

- Okay.
- [Michael] Deja now knows

 the stakes that are involved.

 My job is to convince her

 that I have her best interest
 at heart.

I have to call
the director back, right?

And I could either tell him
I don't know what's going on,

we can't proceed, like,

- you need to come down here.
- Mm-hmm.

I don't know
who he's going to involve.

- The easier...
- I don't think any sharing
was involved, though.

All I know is that I can't
explain what happened.

- Okay.
- The easier option

is to just document that,

um, information was shared.

- Okay.
- Okay? So, if I write out,

um, you know,

"I admit

that I shared,

uh, the answer..."

- But we didn't.
- [Michael]
"...to the triangle..."

Is that crazy to say

that we didn't
share answers, though?

Because I'm like,

I don't know
what he's saying

or if he said that
he looked at my answer

or we didn't.

[Michael]
 Deja wasn't quite convinced.

 So the next tactic
 was to minimize

 the impact of confessing.

I don't know
exactly how it happened.

I just know that
we've got to figure out

the best way forward.

- This is so weird.
- I don't know exactly

how it happened.

It looks like
information sharing.

- If you just tell us
that that happened...
- Say that?

...then what we can do is
I can call the director back

and say that you guys
are cooperating

- and I know him.
- Mm-hmm.

- [Michael]
That's the best thing.
- Okay.

I mean, it's not true
but I'll sign it.

Okay. If you sign
and date it,

I can go and call him back,

and I'll try to get you
out of here.

Okay.

It's very weird,

but...

Okay.

- Thank you very much, Deja.
- You're welcome.

I will be--
I'll be right back.

- Okay.
- Thanks for your patience.

No problem.

So you did an excellent job

of communicating to her

that it was
in her best interest,

that the best way
out of this situation

was to confess.

But it feels so bad.

- Of course.
- I mean, she knows
the seriousness.

She knows
that it's a lie.

I mean, I didn't cheat.

I did not cheat.

Those were
all my answers.

- Hi.
- Hi.

Okay. Uh,
this concludes the study.

I'm gonna give you
a debrief now,

uh, to tell you
about what we're studying.

- Okay.
- So, first of all,

you're not in trouble.

Okay.

The other guy here
works for us.

- [Deja] Okay.
- This is not a study
of logic problems,

it's a study of interrogation

and false confessions.

Mm-hmm.

Good one.

You falsely confessed today.

Mm-hmm. I see that.

How do you feel?

I feel mad at myself

because I'm usually
the one who, like,

you know, just...

sticks to what,

you know, what's right.
I try to, at least.

So, what happened today?

It was just scary, I guess,

because it's an environment
I've never been in before

and then just, like,
all the pressure.

It was just like,

"Uh, well, I guess,
I should just sign it

and say that I did it."

[Michael] Despite knowing
 she was innocent

 and knowing she was admitting
 to breaching a contract,

 Deja signed a confession
 that in a true criminal case

 could be used as evidence
 in a trial against her.

Imagine if
there were consequences

- and this
was a real crime...
- Mm-hmm.

...how easy it is
to get someone to confess

to something without
even punching them

or waterboarding them,

just being nice
and tell them that

it's in their best interest.

Yeah.
That's messed up, actually.

- [Michael] Isn't it?
- That's really crazy.

'Cause there's a lot
of people in prison

for crimes they didn't do.

[music playing]

[Michael]
 The Innocence Project,

 an organization dedicated

 to uncovering
 miscarriages of justice,

 estimates that 20,000 people

 are currently falsely
 imprisoned in the U.S.

 The number one cause
is faulty eyewitness testimony,

 and the number two cause,

 false confession.

 Interrogation techniques
 are unreliable.

 They can fail to produce
 truthful information

 from suspects
 who are good at lying,

 and, perhaps worse,
 they can manipulate

 innocent suspects
 to confess crimes

 they've never committed.

 But neuroscientists
 may have discovered a method

 for extracting the truth
 that's impervious

 to good liars
 and bad interrogators.

 Dr. Peter Rosenfeld
 and his team

 at Northwestern University,

 including Ph.D. candidate
 Anne Ward,

 have developed
 a high-tech method

 for lie detection.

You guys brought
with you today

a P300-based
concealed information test.

How does that work
and how is it different

than a polygraph
or traditional

verbal-only
interrogation techniques?

Well, we're looking at,

um, physiological responses
of the brain

in response to information
that's presented.

And if the information
is meaningful,

like the murder weapon
that a guilty person used,

he will recognize it,

and there's
a brain signature to it.

And so, the machine
that we brought with us

is basically an EEG machine.

So the way my brain,
your brain,

all of our brains
respond to things

that are meaningful
that we recognize is different

than the way it responds
to novel meaningless things?

- Right.
- Has this been used
in a court?

Has it been used
by a prosecution?

Not in court,
There are some
Fifth Amendment issues

as far as betraying,
um, yourself,

based on your brain waves.

But you could use it
for witnesses,

or you could use it
within companies

that are already using
polygraph methods.

Okay. Well, I'm excited
to see this in action.

I'm gonna step out,
you guys are gonna prepare
the first test.

- Okay.
- Excellent. All right.

See you soon.

Okay.

We're ready
for the test.

Thank you
for joining me.

Hannah from Vsauce,

Wren from Corridor Digital.

So, one of us today
is going to be a thief.

[Michael] Per Dr. Rosenfeld's
 instructions,

 we randomly determined
 who would be the thief

 by seeing whoever
 drew the green chip.

Three, two, one.

- [gasps]
- Hannah's the thief.

Oh, my God. I knew it.

[Michael]
So, Hannah, go on in.

- Look at the item.
- [Hannah] Okay.

[Michael]
 In this real-world scenario

 designed by Dr. Rosenfeld,

 the designated thief
 actually takes the item,

 handles it,
 and gets a good look at it.

 This activity causes the item

 to register
 in the subject's mind,

 so they can't help
 but recognize it later.

 The other subjects
 are also required

 to enter the room and sign in
 to prove they were there.

 But never get a look
 at the stolen item.

 And, of course, Dr. Rosenfeld
 and Anne have no idea

 who the thief is.

 Then each of us is tested.

Go ahead
and take a seat here

- and we'll get you all set up.
- Okay.

Basically, I'm just gonna
put a couple electrodes

behind your ears
and a couple on your face,

and then, um,
the EEG cap on your head.

What you're gonna do
is you're gonna use

these two mice
in front of you...

- Mm-hmm.
- ...to respond to the images

that you see on the screen.

So you'll see an image,
a string of numbers,

an image,
a string of numbers.

Anytime you see an image,
no matter what it is,

you're gonna
press this button.

All right. Are you ready?

[music playing]

[Michael]
 The images we were shown

 contained a variety
 of jewelry items,

 including the stolen one.

 Of course, Wren and I
hadn't seen any of them before.

[music playing]

Hannah didn't consciously react
 to any of them.

 But would her brain waves
 reveal

 the one item she recognizes?

 It was time for the results.

So here we are.

Have you reached
a conclusion?

Well, based on what we know,

and we know that
the stolen item was a watch.

And so we looked
at the brain waves

in response to the watch

in comparison
to the brain waves

in response
to other things.

And, uh, we have
two average brain waves,

uh, or event-related
potentials in each frame.

The black one
is the average

brain wave response
to the watch.

The red trace there
is the response

to the other stimuli
all averaged together.

We look for
the peak-to-peak difference,

 the peak down here,
 versus the highest peak

 following this peak.

And we measure that,
and it's rather obvious

that the biggest response
we found was,

uh, Hannah's.

Wow.

[Dr. Rosenfeld]
And interesting thing, Michael,

is that you had
a special response

to the watch in comparison
to the other items.

That would suggest
that there's something special

about that stimulus, the watch,

that is meaningful to you.
Is it?

I collect watches.

I have about 40 or 50
of them.

But Hannah might not have
that kind of excuse.

I don't have
that many watches.

And out of three of you,
she definitely has
the biggest response.

So off to jail.

[music playing]

[Michael] The P300
 concealed information test

 correctly identified
 which one of us was a thief.

But in this next test,
I will be the only suspect,

and they will know
that I've stolen something.

But the question will be,
what did I steal?

Inside this room
are seven boxes,

 and inside those boxes
 are seven different items

 that I've never seen.
My task is to open only one box

 at random and steal that item.

All right.
We've got a...

a camouflage hat.

And that's not all.
During this next test,

I will be implementing
countermeasures

to try to outsmart the test.

 I will think
 a very strong thought

 every time something comes up
 that's irrelevant.

 Will that enable me
 to create brain waves

 powerful and dramatic enough

to not be distinguishable
from my response

to the actual item
I'm trying to conceal?

- Anne.
- [Anne] Hello. Welcome back.

I, uh, committed a crime.

[Michael] Wish me luck,
 because this time,

 there will be punishments
 like in the real world

 where getting caught in a lie
 can have consequences.

 And my friend Adam Savage
 was happy to advise me

 on my punishment.

- Adam.
- Michael.

I am going to be taking

an EEG lie detection test.

- Okay.
- If I lose,

- there need to be stakes.
- Yeah.

- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Naturally, I thought
of Chinese water torture,

 which as you know
 from personal experience,

 is when someone is restrained

 while water is dripped
 on their forehead.

And then right after that,
I thought, I know just the guy

- to talk to about this.
- Okay.

Because I--
I want it to be

actually something
that I'm fearing and dreading.

So, yeah,
we did an episode

on Chinese water torture
on Mythbusters,

and the creepiest thing
that happened

after we did this episode

was that I got an email
from someone

from a throwaway account.

He said,
"We found that randomizing

when the drops occurred
was incredibly effective."

That anything that happens
on a regular periodicity

can become a type
of meditation,

and you can then
tune it out.

If you couldn't predict it,

you're-- he said,

"We found, we were able
to induce a psychotic break

within 20 hours."

Sounds like
the stakes that I want.

- All right.
- Thanks.

You're welcome, sir.

[Michael]
 So now, under the threat

 of Chinese water torture,

 I was extra motivated
 to beat the lie detector.

[music playing]

[Anne] All right.

That is it.

I was trying
to think about all kinds

of frightening scenarios,

I was trying
to tense up to make sure

I was really uncomfortable
the way I was sitting.

Well, for most tests,
that would work.

But we will take a look
at this data and see...

- [Michael] Yes, we will.
- ...what it shows.

[sighs]

Wow. Okay.

I don't think they're going
to be able to figure out

what item I stole.

 I really kept my mind active.

 I was going crazy
 with countermeasures.

 I was sitting uncomfortably,
 I was thinking about

all kinds of really
crazy things.

I was thinking about like,

"What if I have
diarrhea right now?

How would that feel?
How do I hold it back?

And maybe I do have diarrhea."

All these things
that were sort of physical

in nature as well.
I thought a lot about death

and dying
and being dismembered.

 And if they can get it right,

I would probably blame
witchcraft as well as science.

[Dr. Rosenfeld] Well, it's--
I would say that's it.

Yeah, okay.

[Dr. Rosenfeld] We're ready
to give him our best guess.

Hello.

- Hi.
- Hi.

- [Michael] Are you guys ready?
- Yup.

Let me ask you this.
First of all,

how confident do you feel?

Pretty confident.

What did I take?

The camo hat.

- Camo hat.
- Camo hat?

Yeah.

[music playing]

[Michael]
That's impressive.

Did you see any evidence
of countermeasures being used?

Not something I would swear to.

Even while
I was doing the test,

I thought, you know what?

 I'm reacting too quickly
 to the actual item.

I should also treat it
as though it's irrelevant.

I should treat them
all the same.

[Dr. Rosenfeld]
If you are consistently

reacting to all
of the irrelevance

with their specific
countermeasure responses

that you formed
in your mind,

they should produce
bigger P300s also.

But the biggest will still be
produced by the camo hat,

even if you were
countering it also.

That means
I now have to be punished.

[music playing]

Science is improving
in its ability

to read people's minds.

And that raises some
difficult ethical dilemmas.

We would have nothing to fear
from perfect lie detectors

if the people using them
had perfect morals.

So, the prospect of a
scientifically rigorous method

of extracting information,
while exciting,

is also terrifying.

As we continue to probe
interrogation methods

scientifically,
we have to also continue

to probe them ethically.

You know, Chinese water torture
isn't even Chinese.

Its earliest description
comes from Italy

in the 15th century.

And the Chinese name
was added later

to make it sound
more mysterious.

Oh, man, these irregular drops

are supposed to drive you
slowly insane.

You know, I think
this is a lot less

about getting information
and more about punishment.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
