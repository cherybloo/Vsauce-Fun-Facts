hey everybody it's the wacky Gamers okay

Adam's lame but it's us it's Jeff and

Adam I'm Adam and we're here to do

another versus video yes we are a lot of

people seem to like them so we're going

to keep going but this time it's another

user suggestion keep posting user

suggestion yes let's what well let's say

some of the user suggestions that they

sent us Jeff okay so one of the ones

they gave us was Harry Potter versus

Percy Jackson it's kind of interesting

that was badani yep we decided it would

end up in a make out session between the

two because the two of them would just

get for each other uh the next one Mr

Freeze versus Subzero that was from

geekam that was pretty good idea but we

decided that uh they're just too icy

cold for us but it was a cool idea thank

you for posting it and the last one we

wanted to call out that we won't do but

we thought was cool is megaan versus

Punisher that was interesting we argued

about it for a while and then ended up

in a [ __ ] fight Mega Man would win Mega

Man would win um the the one we're going

to do today also from X Nemesis katos

versus Thor but before that want to talk

about what happened the last time so we

did we did Bowser versus the Hulk Bowser

versus the Hulk you want to tell him

what we found out about the Hulk Jeff's

uh argument for why Bowser would win was

basically centered around the fact that

the Incredible Hulk can get hurt by fire

well unfortunately Stan Lee listened to

our podcast not really someone who knows

Stan Lee listened and asked Stan and and

Stan said the Hulk is immune to

Fireballs immune to Fireballs which I

said okay so we're going to give that

one to the Hulk quns regardless of the

comments we're just going to have to

throw that one out Iron Man versus

Master Chief was much more debated the

user spoke and it seems that Master

Chief has the edge especially if you

consider Tony Stark and master chief

outside of their their um I wouldn't say

costumes but their armor their armor

yeah anyway now onto the task at hand

all right Thor versus katos Thor versus

katos you want to take video games again

and I'm going to take comic book cuz

this time they're going to win heartily

again like Master Chief Style

let's let's hear it go ahead Throw Down

The Gauntlet no I want to hear your bull

crap you want to he you want to hear my

bull crap go ahead all right well uh

Thor as we all know God of Thunder you

mean Fabio and a Viking helmet see

you're going to interrupt me when I'm

talking first off Fabio is a strong man

did you see him hit like if if Thor can

take a goose to the face the same way

Fabio did no question about it Thor wins

if Fabio took a dick to the face like

Thor does no doubt kattos is going to

kick his ass Thor has never taken a dick

to the face Thor is so powerful he once

reconstructed the moon can you say that

about kattos that wouldn't help you in a

fight sure you you make a moon and then

you throw it at somebody but you got to

make the moon meanwhile katos just

sliced your head off Thor has the the

Hammer of the Gods of exil Blades of

Exile boo whatever the Hammer of the god

he's got one hammer of a god which it's

a freaking Hammer I mean seriously could

you come up with a Lamer weapon no sharp

edges it's just War object a blunt

object actually the back of the hammer

has a blade on it not in any picture I

ever saw I'm going to some UL picture

picture picture picture picture of well

you're showing old picture old picture

old picture oh so we're not we're not

counting the back picture tros never had

a lame weapon now it's single lame

weapon he took the weapons from every

God in the Greek pantheon every God

every God he's got the power of Hermes

which is kind of gay um I will say but

he's got he's the God of War okay so so

his sole purpose in life is to kick some

ass so your argument is that he has uh

the power of Hermes no all meaning that

he can run fast he's got the blade of AA

here's the thing here's the thing with

the with running fast actually Thor is

so fast he was able to build trenches

before Quicksilver the fastest Marvel

character could get there it doesn't

matter bam he's fashion than Quicksilver

and I'll tell you this what speed going

to do for you when Kratos just whooped

your ass calls the spirits of the dead

and just kicked your ass here's a little

not fact uh Thor is like the most

powerful Marvel character there is he's

the [ __ ] closest thing to have

superos is the most badass video game

character of all time well no doubt he

is he killed every Greek God and he been

killed multiple times and crawled his

ass back out of Hades and just whooped

some more ass oh if we were going to

talk about being killed

every single Marv character has been

killed multiple times needs to eat

golden app to be immortal just stays or

Immortal forever well you know what

golden apples how how [ __ ] [ __ ]

is that you know what oh you know

what halfway

through I win no you don't here's why

you don't win because halfway through

the fight with Thor Kratos would have to

stop and solve a stupid boring puzzle

that he can't figure out because the

camera angle never changes Thor wins

yeah you think the Thor game's going to

be any better H the Thor game is going

to be Flawless the Thor game is based on

a freaking movie which is going to be

terrible because that's how most comic

book movies end

up I don't know if you saw the Daredevil

movie wait a minute but no wait a minute

there a lot of good comic book movies

you know what would be a terrible movie

krto God of War the movie no it wouldn't

yes it would no it wouldn't it it would

be as good as the Resident Evil movie

exactly that's what I

said katto would just get out

his sole purpose in life he doesn't care

about other people he could care less if

he destroys the planet and destroying

Thor but Thor would be oh someone's

going to get hurt one of my poor Nordic

[ __ ] is going to get hurt katos no go

ahead and kill the [ __ ] no here's

here's the thing Kratos has no friends

and no allies whereas Thor has the

entire Pantheon he

doesn't cuz he kills them all and steals

their powers if Thor had any coones he

would have killed all the ERS and taking

their powers look I've played God of War

I the powers aren't really that useful

the weapons are the most useful thing

the powers kind of suck the weapons are

what he took from all the other gods cuz

you clearly didn't play the game I

played the game you from Hermes you get

running yeah and from uh what you get

from AA a bow and arrow okay he also

[ __ ] Aphrodite I'm just saying he did

[ __ ] Aphrodite that wasck yeah all right

so we're agreeing it was Kratos okay

Kratos gets more action but I think Thor

would win

I I totally disagree yeah me too Kratos

killed all the [ __ ] guys yeah I win

of course of course the first timeone

suceeded in these arguments and well you

know I had to put up a fight but

seriously he's killed every God you know

okay we we'll have another one don't

forget to post uh I know this ending is

kind of lame but don't forget to post

the ones you want down below we will get

to them we will argue them stupidly just

like we do these one and uh we will call

out your good ones if you post them and

we decide not to argue the give me give

me give me I still think Thor would win

actually or why do you think Thor's

going to win Adam likes Fabio cuz he's

kind of gay you just have sympathy for

bald

[Laughter]

people
