hey everyone it's lacy and this is BTW

on

Vsauce what's on the plate for this week

how about some video game cliches

whether it's save points Health meters

three lives or certain things that have

shown up through generation after

generation of video game what if if we

could take those cliches and put them

into real life the first one is all

about health if I had the chance to

capture this concept I would not only

save the medical world but I think I

would help out a lot of different people

like those people on jackass happy about

[Music]

it you can either eat something like a

mushroom or you take a potion my example

comes from Castlevania where you eat a

piece of chicken to get full

[Music]

health oh

[Music]

or you could just eat a bunch of Double

Downs that might always help the next

cliche is a concept that's used in tons

of games I could use so many examples

but I'm going to use the example from

N64 Golden Eye in which you have tons of

items on you at all times and yet you

look perfectly normal no one would ever

think that James Bond is carrying a

grenade launcher or a rocket launcher or

a machine gun because he looks perfectly

normal in his tuxedo

[Music]

right I'm

[Music]

sorry

have you ever noticed in a lot of

different games especially in RPGs that

you have those menus that pop up that

have different phrases that decide Your

Destiny or where you're going in the

game did you ever think that those might

help you in real life I mean a good

example would be on a date perhaps tits

or GTFO or romantic walk on the beach

what if that just came into your daily

schedule you have turned the key of

Destiny only you have the power to

control it the power to choose a path I

want to start the car path to Greatness

I want to go you have the strength to

wield this power I want to [ __ ] go

remember that the power I want to go and

only you can hold on the destiny aits

remember to Choose Wisely let's face it

our world revolves around money so in

games it's a common thing that you can

get money for beating stuff up so I

thought what if you could kill someone

in real life without

consequences and get

money with that that be

okay well that's all I have for you this

week I hope you enjoyed what you saw if

I forgot a video game cliche that you'd

really like to see go ahead and put in

the comment section below until next

time I'm Lacy and uh BTW there aren't

any extra lives

[Music]
