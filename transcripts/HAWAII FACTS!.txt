Vsauce! Michael here,
and I am back from vacation.

You may not have known,
but I just spent the last week in Hawaii

with my mother and my sister.
She's the one hiding right

there. I worked on my tan, grew my beard back out,
and most importantly

I learned a lot and I wanted to share
some of that knowledge with you today.

In fact, on Saturday, I'm gonna release
a brand new

Vsauce Leanback, made out of videos from
producers all over YouTube

that I was inspired to watch after
learning things in Hawaii.

It's going to be exciting, but today,
right now, let's get started and begin

with Pearl Harbor. In 1941 more than 300
Japanese fighters attacked

the US naval base at Pearl Harbor.
The USS Arizona was one of the many

battleships damaged

or sunk and the Arizona was left

right where it sank. It's still there and
a memorial has been built right on top

of it.

From the memorial you can see something
pretty surprising.

The ship is still leaking fuel.

It once held more than a million gallons
of fuel and so

even today, 70 years later,
it continues to leak five gallons of gas

every day into the ocean. In fact, you can
actually smell it from the memorial.

The Navy hasn't fixed it yet because the
leak is seen as a constant reminder

of what happened and as tears that have continued to flow

ever since the day of the attack.
Pearl Harbor also has this giant map,

which shows you something else I was
excited about being close to -

the International Date Line.
It's an arbitrary line where the new day

begins. You see, when the Sun rises in the
morning for these Pacific Islands,

different days are beginning.
In Samoa

it might be 9 in the morning on
Thursday, but just a few hundred miles

away,

across the dateline,
it's 9 in the morning on

Friday. One day in the future. This means
that some pretty weird things can happen.

For instance,

Amelia Earhart disappeared without a trace

while traveling from New Guinea to Howland Island.

She was talking, communicating and most definitely live

on July 3rd.
But then she crossed the dateline

and disappeared forever on July 2nd.

At the Dole Plantation you can take a train

called the Pineapple Express and see
coffee being grown.

Or you can visit Kona and toast the
camera with coffee

made from beans right below you.
If you prefer softer beans, grab a shaved ice

from Matsumoto

with red beans at the bottom.
Or

eat some shrimp so fresh that they were
grown in ponds

right behind the shrimp shack.
This is the hospital Barack Obama was born in

and the top of Diamond Head,
a volcanic tuff cone in Honolulu,

has a great view of the city, but it's so
windy that all around the steep sides

are clumps

of lost hats.
By the way,

the camera I've been using entire time
says it's waterproof

and to find out if it is, I'm gonna send my
sister down. Good luck.

Finally, Mauna Kea, the highest point in Hawaii

and, if measured from its seafloor base, a mountain

taller than Mount Everest. It's above the
clouds, so driving up is really freaky.

You literally drive into and through the cloud line.

The dry air, high-altitude, and comair make it perfect

for observing space. I didn't get to use
those telescopes, but people had smaller

ones I could use

pointed right at Saturn.
I tried to get camera footage of it and this

is the best I could do.

To learn more about Saturn

and Hawaii's volcanic activity and a
whole host of other issues, be sure to

watch

our Leanback coming out this Saturday.
It's an autoplaying playlist

that I host full of video clips from
producers all over YouTube, so they get

the views

and if you like what they make,
you can subscribe to them. Stay tuned for that.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
