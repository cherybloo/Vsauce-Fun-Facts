This is what heaven is like.
And things just got a little too real.

It's episode 38 of IMG!

Okay, so this is Katy Perry

and this is Paula Deen.
Uh-oh.

Because this is Tom Hanks and this is 50 Cent.

Coincidence? Here's a caterpillar whose
pattern resembles

little penguins.
And what if Obama was a white guy?

Crystal e-mailed me a picture
she took of a cooler lid that says

'wow, look at them jugs.'
But, onto the dessert.

"Freakgirl" makes beautiful cupcakes,
but the pun award goes to her

'Up-cakes.'
Parents can be scary,

but this picture is one of the most
terrifying I've ever seen.

Can you make sense of this

shape? What is it?
And in these next two pictures

can you find the faces?
And that's right, you guessed it,

it is now time for 99 pictures of bananas.

Enjoy them all.

Here's an artist who meticulously cuts
paper with an exacto blade to make

swirling portrait out of a single

sheet.
And here is a giraffe licking a squirrel.

How about a panda on a rocking horse?
Or face paint a famous paintings?

Warhol, Pollock, 'The Scream,'

Magritte, 'Starry Night.'
Pocky box delivers realistic South Park families

and Mario delivers

any performance-enhancing drug you want,
because now

you're swimming with portals.
Hello?

Ooohh.
Baby hands are delicious,

but after the town of Kolmanskop, Namibia was abondoned wind and sand

re-claimed the homes,
leaving these eerie desert rooms.

Also eerie are underground neutrino detectors.

Eerie and very, very large.
