hello Vsauce Michael here and today I

have 16 more creative games just for you

so why wait let's hit the ground running

or rather DJing record tripping takes

the feeling and live soundtrack mixing

of scratching a record with your scroll

wheel and transposes it onto other

objects like a wooden

maze or a windmill you can scratch to

plant falling seed famous objects from

Classic Movies looks really slick and is

a great way to test your movie knowledge

it's like hangman but you only get three

mistakes this one's less of a game and

more of a laboratory of color and math

it replicates a viewing window to create

a kaleidoscopic image look I made a V

for Vsauce kind of In Touch the Bubbles

you slash cute little balls with your

mouse while carefully navigating away

from red stuff but if you want something

more human try pman in this game you're

a superhero who must Dodge the poop

monsters attacks while collecting

lemonade from friendly girls so you can

pee on him prefer secretions from the

other end try spewer this little guy

wants to get to the exit but sometimes

he needs a puke thrust adding to the

game's complexity you can swim in your

own puke to avoid dangers and eat it

back up again for future

use chaos Escape might give you a heart

attack you have to move your mouse

around the screen as violent industrial

shapes fly around in perfect sync with

pounding techno avoid the red stuff and

be sure to turn on your scrobe light

music catch 2 is exactly the same except

the opposite its shapes are synced with

soothing piano music that breathes

around you catch the yellow notes for

points and to grow larger and purple

ones to quickly grab safe shapes avoid

the red notes and relax if your job is

so terrible you can't relax and you'd

rather die here's a game where you play

an office worker and the entire point is

to kill

yourself but if suicide isn't really

your thing and you'd rather find a way

to have fun while working just make it

look like you're working exit is a

simple game that appears to be an Excel

spread sheet when really it's just you

bouncing around off the walls let's get

puzzled interlocked is great you're

given 3D puzzles that you can inspect

and then move around and pull apart but

for a more organic feel play the role of

a tree and choose how to grow so that

you wind up collecting Rings it's much

tougher than you'd imagine Sugar Sugar

lets you draw lines with your mouse to

make pads for sugar to fall into cups

it's relaxing and

sweet thank you if you prefer mechanics

to drawing play Gra strain where you

have to drag in the right Machinery to

transport grain into a bucket Paxon is a

creative mashup where you play Pac-Man

complete with powerups food and ghosts

zip carefully to close them in until

it's so claustrophobic that you get to

move to the next level and as a fitting

way to end this video you have to burn

the rope is probably the flash game with

the best ending ever but luckily our

journey doesn't have to end there

because guess what there's a new episode
