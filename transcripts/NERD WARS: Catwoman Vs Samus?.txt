hey there I got that pizza you ordered

oh Jesus it's sexy nerd it's time for

another nerd Wars sexy nerd Wars this

one to women it's going to be Samus

Aaron versus Catwoman from Jax Kobe

thanks Jack Kobe thank you Jack Kobe I

know there's different color outfits but

uh Wikipedia basically didn't describe

that they were uh any real reason to

have them fashion but they're hot no

they're not you can have pink Samus or

yellow Samus or green Samus what's up

Sam look if we're going to if we're

going to talk about outfits let's give

the point to the woman the girl with

apic Graphics at the end of Metron no

let's give a point to the woman who

actually shows some cleavage can you fit

a pixel between your fingers I think

that's one of those questions like if a

tree falls in the cleavage what are you

talking about where she was stacked no

no she her head was about two pixels

wide and her boobs each were Four Pix

what talking about do you even know what

cleavage is you don't know what cleavage

is there

was space between no there wasn't there

was one white pixel right here you dick

what one white pixel be honest be honest

there's no cleavage she has no cleavage

you have to go back and look I I played

Metroid this morning Metroid the

original and got to the end no you

didn't no I played all of them no you

didn't yeah and there's no you did not

morning you did not play them this

morning if we can if you can lie I can

lie point to Catwoman to Samus Aaron for

being a badass okay so let's just say

they get in a fight they actually go and

fight it out mhm Samus is going to win

and and what would your argument there

be she's got guns she can crawl into a

little ball and spin around and

Catwoman's a cat and she'd just be

like wrong Catwoman Catwoman Catwoman

has

F Catwoman has fought and beat numerous

people who didn't roll into little balls

exactly and that's her that's her

Kryptonite no that's the only power that

the Metroid chick has she can do

somersaults all right which is is that's

like saying just because Green Lantern

can make [ __ ] cryptonite doesn't mean

he can't he can't make Kryptonite kryp

he cannot make cry you God read a book

here's the thing all right the only

thing the Metroid chick can do is

somersault all right and if you've ever

turn into a ball if you've ever if

you've ever beaten up a 2-year-old all

right they do the same moves don't even

try it they do the same moves she's got

nothing she's a worthless crap

wait your 2-year-old can I beat up a

turn into a little perfectly round

sphere completely entertain a cat for

hours and hours and hours on end and

then and then Samus Aaron would pop out

and go bam Missle to the head it's not

like Missle to the head it's not like

she got Choo training choso what who

Catwoman train with not the cholos I'll

give you that cholos all right name the

best character you think Catwoman won

against the best character like the most

powerful character the Catwoman actually

defeated I believe she defeated a

homeless guy that was the answer he was

going to say no I was going to say Bane

Bane's just a big guy no brains she's a

poor man's Mega Man and she sucks did

you really just say that yeah I did it's

a better character than Mega Man bll

you're right I know Mega Man versus Sam

Aaron Mega Man will kick her ass Mega

Man would but since we're not arguing

that it's against Catwoman and Cat you

lose and the editing on this is going to

be awesome cuz I'm just going to show

Hal Berry Catwoman the whole time okay I

want to make a point here the hle Berry

Catwoman has nothing to do with it's

Canon it's Canon no it's not canon it's

not canon it's not a comic

book we didn't say comic books no the

same the same way Captain N all right

they had the chick for Metroid on

Captain N not canon I'm going to

invalidate then Samus Aaron in her

yellow

suit it's just disgusting but yeah the

yellow suit is

[Music]

gross Catwoman wins okay we want to know

what you think who do you think won cat

or woodwin no Sam is Aaron put it in the

comments and uh let us know if you got

other ones you want to argue yeah and

send us pictures of you somersaulting
