hi welcome to wackygamer

hey

hi hi hi hi i have a beard again yeah

weird it's like we filmed those videos a

month ago so today on wacky game we're

gonna be talking about uh some of your

uh suggestions for nerd wars indeed you

guys like the format of the wtf edition

uh so we're gonna stick with that and

we're just gonna go through a bunch of

them and see what comes out of our mouse

yay

what kind of dirty

ew drink the flash versus sonic the

hedgehog

flash fastest man alive

he actually

transcends time yeah uh sonic

collects rings

i i say sonic what

dude's got all that gold i mean he'll

buy some weaponry to kill the flash

yeah um actually no it's going to be the

flash thank you yeah all right

the flash can just rewind time until he

goes back before sonic bought the

weapons and then

caps them

sonic is beaten by a wall the flash can

vibrate his body so much that he can go

through solid matter

yeah so we're gonna have to go with uh

snarf on that one

next up snarf versus the ewoks now snarf

being the annoying guy from the

thundercats versus an ewok being the

annoying guys from return of the jedi

yeah um uh would anybody watch that how

are we defining who wins are we fighting

who would win in a fight or who would

annoy people the most you know i don't i

don't even think that we should we

should do it who wins i i want to know

about the circumstances of the it's a

fight to the death and they both have to

die

i think that's the thing i'm going to

have to give it to the e-box because

they have spears i've never seen snarf

carry a weapon snarf doesn't carry a

weapon so yeah i guess you'd have to

give it to the e1 cause the ewok's the

only one with the pointy thing but but

you'd hope that somehow they'd screw up

enough to impale both of themselves

maybe the ewok would be dumb enough to

like stick the spear in the ground and

then they'd just both jump on it yeah

that would be that would be nice the

victory nice for both of them snarf

ungawa you know well that was a good

song

next up shredder versus doctor doom

really yeah dr doom is kind of an idiot

are we are we talking otto von doom or

my my physician no we're talking about

auto bondu okay because my doctor is

kind of stupid you have a doctor named

doctor doom yeah that's why i went to

it's spelled with an e at the end isn't

it it's it's d-o-e-m-e it's but it's

german so it's still not doom

well yeah okay here's the thing i know

dr doom and the shredder look a little

similar uh the shorts are wearing metal

yeah they got the metal players

now again for those who don't know

shredder from teenage mutant ninja

turtles yeah von doom from comic books

right okay uh shredder couldn't beat

some pubescent teenage turtles

and how is he going to be in there

doom

he gets so upset about this i i would

actually make an argument for shredder

how are you gonna do it bebop and

rocksteady

are gonna come along

and just distract von doom

our doctor doom so much

doctor doom's gonna get pissed off and

kill himself

okay

all right i guess uh suicide based on

you know annoying how how badly the the

tv series ruined the comic book the tv

series was awesome

the comic book was great

it is true even though it was black and

white it was really it was really good

but it was black and white who cares i

couldn't get past that initially

it's like i need color

i can't imagine anything if it's just

shades of grey

let's move on okay the last one

rorschach

watchman rorschach he's the guy with the

white mask and the black patterns that

move all over it versus the punisher

this is a comic really good fight this

is actually a really good one maybe

we'll do a full one maybe not but maybe

we'll do i could talk about this forever

uh i who who do you think jeff who do

you think

see i know more rorschach than punisher

so i would have to side with war shock

only because i go with what i know yeah

um but rorschach i think is

in my mind a little crazier a little

more unstable

and more likely to pull something out of

his ass that that punisher

punisher just seems to work on rage

where rorschach is a little bit of like

well yeah

the thing is you know rorschach just

uses what's in his environment whereas

the punisher uses the weapons he brings

to a fight

and the environment so i think really

the thing is like where are they

fighting

yeah and you know if i were to jungle if

they were fighting in the woods i'd give

it to the punisher yeah i probably would

too if they were fighting in this

building or an office building yeah i'd

probably give it to rorschach uh that

being said i'd want to see rorschach win

that being said i would just like to see

somebody film that fight i would i would

love if somebody can make that happen

out there you know that would be one of

those epic like cinematic moments why

don't they have just a rorschach comic

book

let's go write it we should yeah let's

get out of here let's go

check us out back again we've got stuff

against the comment videos in the

comments thumbs up oh my god rorschach

it's gonna be awesome get it man

we're gonna give is it copy written i

don't think it is all right good
