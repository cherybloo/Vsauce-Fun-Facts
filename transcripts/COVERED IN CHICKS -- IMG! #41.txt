A rooster...cat?
And Ronald orders a number three.

It's episode 41 of IMG!

City life.

Oh hi.
And here's a necktie that's formal

and manly, though, of course,
I prefer one piece

cat faces. Too much coverage?
Well, try on one of these

or just wear a slice of bread on your face. It's

almost as good as squishing it up against bars.

Hayashi Natsumi takes photos of herself relaxing

mid-jump.

Tug on a blowhole

with this whale tissue holder and the
movie poster for The Dark Knight Rises

contains an awesome

hidden bat shape,
but some people see a jumping unicorn.

Here kid, have a sparkler.
I mean, say cheese.

Doh. The baby's okay,
so take your dog for a walk

skate and then put a price sticker on Moby
Dick just right

and you get... 
Wow, okay, look, let's just get some knowledge.

In Canada, postal codes are alphanumeric.
And in British Columbia

you can visit V4G1N4.

Alright, let's be more mature.
Every year during the wet season, Lake Titicaca

overflows into lake Poop√≥, which in
turn overflows into Salar de Uyuni,

the world's largest salt bed.
It is so big

it contains 70 percent of our world's lithium reserves

and it's so flat that orbiting
satellites use it

to determine the steadiness of their altitudes.
When it rains,

Salar de Uyuni becomes the world's
largest mirror.

But if that's too much water for you,
you don't have to travel very far to get to

Antofagasta Region of the Atacama
Desert, the driest

place on Earth. On average,
the entire desert only receives one

millimeter of rain each year. And some
weather stations out there have yet

in human history to have recorded
rainfall. In fact, between 1570

and 1971 it is estimated that no significant water

fell there at all.
It's so near sterile

NASA uses the region to test Mars rovers
and in some areas of the desert

those rovers found not a single trace

of life.

Panagiotis showed that with the right
clouds the Sun

could become a smiley face.
He also showed off an inquisitive

beard and Tim Ryan helped out.
Okay.

I'll go left and then I'll go... wait.

I'm just gonna lay around with some chicks.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
