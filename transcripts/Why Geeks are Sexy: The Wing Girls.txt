hey Vsauce I've got something special

for you today I'm sure you've heard of a

wing man before but have you ever heard

of a wing girl well guess what there's

two of them right now

they met with Ben and Mark in LA like a

few weeks ago and I said hey wait a

second ladies what do you think of guys

who are kind of geeky and they said Shh

No

we'll make a video instead and that's

exactly what they did so without further

ado lay back relax and enjoy the show

hey Vsauce what's up I'm Jack and I'm

star and we're the wing girls and we're

invading your channel just for one night

only so stay with us yes so we ran into

Ben and Mark from Key of Awesome and

they wanted us to do something with

Michael yes so here we are and we're

gonna give a little bit of dating advice

maybe some of you need it maybe some of

you don't that might as well watch not

either way what are you gonna do yeah

you're on the Vsauce channel anyways we

have videos like how to flirt how to

kiss how to get out of the friendzone

like that one that's the night one so if

you like any of that stuff

check us out so we wanted to talk about

geeks okay yes because we do love geeks

and we were both geeks in junior high

and high school and kind of still are

the thing to remember is like if you're

a geek now then you know maybe you are

getting picked on and maybe you're not

the hero of your school but those

football jocks over there are gonna be

working at Burger King when you're like

awesome one day you're working for being

awesome right and there's the Burger

King not there's anything wrong with

that no no totally okay I love fries

especially curly fries

yeah not no oh that is hot well we're

talking about no what are we talking

about so today we're gonna tell you how

to use being a geek quote-unquote to

your advantage with the ladies right

because we're not trying to turn you

into something you're not no we're just

saying hey this is your saying here's

what you should do with it

to get a girlfriend exactly just some

attention from the girls

exactly okay so interests are sexy no

matter what your interest is girls like

you can use it to your advantage yes say

you're really good at computers and you

spend your nights like taking apart your

harddrive and put it back together or

whatever if you see a girl in class that

needs computer help or you see that

she's got a really old computer like

offer to soup it up for her you know

like you've got the RAM tell her to

bring it over and you'll fix it like

Baylor instant holla and you know what's

weird that all that technical stuff is

the new form of chivalry but the other

thing you should remember is don't talk

her ear off about what you're doing

don't be like well I just had to unplug

a wire and then put this other thing in

there and ya don't hear it we don't even

know what yours is telling you about

what happened on Sex in the City just do

it and then give her the finished

product and be like you're wham bam

thank you ma'am

yeah that's hot okay guys so tell us

what your passion is what's your

interest that is really cool and that

you spend a lot of time on comment below

right here cuz we want to know yeah

what's your passion alright another

thing you can remember is group

activities equal face time all right

so if you've got all the latest

equipment you got the Wii you've got the

Xbox 305 you got you know all the latest

things and we really you know we know

we're talking about but if you got all

the latest equipment then you can invite

people over your household I'm a little

like here we just got a new copy of Just

Dance 2 you know that's a game um let's

play it together yeah and you know at

first I might just start out a bunch of

guys doing it and then you know they can

invite their sisters or their friends

and you guys can all like start hanging

out and try to go for a game that's like

an interactive one like I know they're

karaoke games out there tennis games

yeah that work everyone al and right I

love rock yeah Robin yeah right yeah and

drummer is a really sexy on either

drummer okay guys so use your niche to

get girls okay there are plenty of girls

out there that LARP that are gamers that

you know go to comic-con it's there may

be harder to find you might have to find

that some of them on the internet but

they are out there yeah you put yourself

out there and you're the only

guy out of all those kind of shy guys

that is actually talking to her you're

gonna win that's true I mean we went to

comic-con a couple years ago yeah there

were lots of girls there and you know

then you're kind of finding like-minded

people that are into the same stuff the

us you've already got a common ground to

start from yeah it's plenty to talk

about already that's right

you talk about Legend of Zelda we don't

show them how the videogame returns we

are as old a guy oh we did if he was

smoking okay guys so biggest thing to

remember is to just be yourself

that's huge yeah huge we don't want you

guys to turn into Brad Pitt if you want

you to be you and use what you've got to

your advantage

mm-hmm well sexy yeah and if you're

actually talking to girls you're ten

steps ahead of all your friends totally
