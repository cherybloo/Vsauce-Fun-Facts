hey Vsauce how's it going Michael here

and today I'm trying out a new type of

show basically I just want to collect

all the awesome images that I've seen

this week into one place last week was a

source of a bunch of fantastic images so

without further ado welcome to Episode

one of IMG

if not even floodwaters can get between

you and video games you're gonna love

the newest screenshots that were

released for the upcoming Battletoads 3d

I'm sorry that pictures like five years

old but let's move on to stuff that was

popular this week first stop Kotaku

besides Chris Brown wearing kirby

bowling we also got the best use of

pixelation ever it's a hot girl blurred

out with pixelation to look like

Princess Peach as a great follow up

here's the equivalent of a visual cold

shower terrifying pokemon from eat toast

but now it's time for a challenge named

every character in this illustration of

the Marvel Universe in the style of

Megaman it's called of course mega

marvelous yesterday this picture was

circulating a lot rumor had it that it

was taken at a Justin Bieber concert but

what bothers me is how sad this kid

looks but if it doesn't make you sad

maybe this will last week man eggs calm

asked what if Mario faced real

consequences

of course the only person worse off that

Mario is a person who owns cats last

week cat versus human reminded me why I

need to get a girlfriend or at least

talk to someone besides my kitties

because cats during emergencies not a

good idea The Huffington Post assembled

a great list of fictional characters

caught in real life my favorites Mario

and Luigi Carmen Sandiego and that puffy

kid from up Earl s scoured Flickr for

the best midair poses and BuzzFeed

brought us the 15 gayest pictures of the

Pope they also brought us incredible

reimagining of popular current games as

8-bit and 16-bit games and what the heck

a guy who carves tiny teeny-weeny

sculptures out of pencil leg finally

today the Chive posted a hilarious

series of pictures an employee

supposedly emailed to her entire office

in what has to be the most creative

clever and simultaneously sexy way to

quit enjoy

okay that's it for the first episode of

IMG but there's way more to come in fact

I would really love input from you guys

so feel free to submit your favorite

images of the week to our Facebook page

over at facebook.com/vsaucetwo mean and

as far as I'm concerned the more gifts

the better
