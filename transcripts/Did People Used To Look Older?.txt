hey Vsauce Michael here at the age of

18. Carl Sagan looked like a teenager

but it doesn't take long in an old high

school yearbook to find teenagers who

look surprisingly old

these people are all in their 20s but so

are these people

this is Elizabeth Taylor when she was

just 17 and here are some high school

students from the 70s

did people used to look older Brandon

McCarthy asked on Twitter and evidence

poured in people shared photos of their

parents in their early twenties their

dad at 21 their mom at 18 or 19. their

dad at 45. one user shared their husband

at 27 and what his father looked like at

23.

and there's pretty much an entire

subculture around how old footballers

looked decades ago 24

31 33 29

27.

it's not uncommon to think that there's

something more grown up about the way

people used to be to look back and think

that people seemed older at a younger

age than they do now

let's call it retrospective aging it

doesn't happen to everyone people do not

and never have aged similarly and

there's even the opposite observation

that kids these days grow up too fast

but it's a popular question and subject

of numerous memes

so

is it real

or is it an illusion fueled by

cherry-picked examples that feeds Rosy

Nostalgia for a time when people were

tough and didn't have it as easy as you

kids have it now

well as it turns out

both

humans today really are aging more

slowly than their historic counterparts

changes in lifestyle nutrition smoking

habits Healthcare early life conditions

and Skin Care particularly the use of

sunscreen are a huge part of it by

comparing measures of metabolic

cardiovascular inflammatory kidney liver

and lung function across time

researchers at Yale and USC have found

that we are in fact staying younger for

longer than we used to so does that mean

that 60 is the new 50.

almost their results suggest that

between the early 90s and the late 2000s

60 became the new

56. 40 became the new 37 and a half and

20 became the new 19. oh also during the

last century dentistry and Orthodontics

have played a huge cosmetic role in the

kinds of faces we see in parts of the

world

but interestingly when faces in

magazines are measured from the 1930s to

today the only significant change has

been that across all ethnicities the

media is now exposing us to larger lips

also retroactive aging can occur over

short time spans when I was a freshman

the seniors in my high school seemed so

old to me

by the time I was a senior myself I

looked in the mirror and at my peers and

I was like we are them now but we don't

seem as old as they did

what's going on isn't just about bodies

first of all the seniors I looked at

when I was a freshman truly were older

than me at that time they graduated and

went away and later when I was a senior

I saw myself as I was but in my mind's

eye I saw the earlier seniors as they

appeared to me when I was younger

retrospective aging seems to also be

about perspective let's go back to this

tweet this is George wimp playing Norm

on the TV show Cheers now when cheers

premiered went was indeed 34 but I

looked it up and this image is actually

from episode 24 of season 5 when Wint

was 38 so we're not comparing Apples to

Apples here however this is an image of

George went at 34 and Ashley Fairbanks

made some alterations and a good point

however here's the rub these alterations

don't make Wint look more like a 34 year

old they make him look more like a 34

year old

today

similarly giving the Golden Girls modern

day hairstyles and makeup drops their

apparent age a lot superficial Styles

and mannerisms can often make not just a

big difference

but all the difference which supports

the hypothesis that retrospective aging

is often

an illusion

modes of self-expression are always

changing clothing

hairstyles

accessories makeup

mannerisms language body language now

modes can come back but never exactly

the context is always a little bit

different

and from what's available or acceptable

at any one time we each draw ways of

appearing or being in the world and even

if you don't care about how you look or

think about how you act what options you

even have are dictated by what's

currently popular or normal or being

pushed on people like you

few of us stay at the stream drawing

what's new all our lives for various

reasons we often wander away with our

catch perhaps it's because we settle

into an identity we're comfortable with

or fear the taboo of not dressing our

age or simply run out of time to care

but when we're gone

the stream keeps changing

and we get older and continue to use the

mannerisms and styles we grabbed a while

back

eventually to whatever those Styles

initially evoked a new connotation is

added

old person

not because the look or behavior is

intrinsically for the elderly but

because those who use it us became old

ourselves

if you want to look older what do you do

well you can dress the way older people

dress and the thing is that's often how

they used to dress too

we think people looked older in the past

because they look the way old people do

today

Dale Irby a gym teacher at Prestonwood

Elementary School in Dallas Texas posed

for his first yearbook photo in 1973.

the following year he accidentally wore

the same outfit again he says he was

embarrassed at first but his wife Kathy

challenged him to do it again

so he did

and he never stopped

what he gave us is a great exaggerated

example of how what once connoted youth

comes to be associated with old age the

people we keep seeing a style on get

older and older themselves until we

think of the style itself as being for

old people

retrospective aging then is double

pronged both real and illusory people in

the past really did age faster than us

because of differences in nutrition and

lifestyle and medicine but much if not

most can be chalked up to the fact that

we think people like this are dressed

like old people but that's an

anachronism they're dressed like old

people from the future

the old people they would become

has anyone ever dressed like a young

person from the future well it happened

in 1941 at the reopening of the South

Fork bridge in Canada a crowd came out

to celebrate and photos were taken in

2010 the photos were digitized and

placed online that's when this guy was

noticed a time traveling hipster

why a time traveler wouldn't bother to

blend in and why with all of history to

visit he chose the reopening of a bridge

in the 40s

no one knew the photo was confirmed to

be undoctored and researchers put

forward the idea that this man

was not in fact a time traveler that his

shirt wasn't an ironic screen print but

simply bore the logo of the Montreal

Maroons a nearby hockey team at the time

they said his sunglasses and knit

sweater were not unusual for the 40s nor

was his portable camera the only thing

that was unusual about him was how

casual his attire was

and they're probably right but this all

raises the exciting possibility that

someone out there right now possibly

even you is unknowingly dressed like

people in the future will and your

appearance in photos will someday freak

them out

you know it might be fun to start

dressing even more casually or in some

other odd way on the off chance that you

happen to nail it and years from now you

are worshiped as a time traveler

oh that reminds me of today's sponsor

I'm ready for you with open arms and

open neurons

wow

whoa

who's that guy

does he look like a bill a mark a Justin

or a josh

pause right now if you'd like to think

about it

according to research from Millsaps

College in Miami University

this is Mark

or at least this is what we think people

named Mark look like

by asking people to make and rate

digitally created faces researchers were

able to put together prototypical faces

for a number of different names

this is apparently what we think a Josh

looks like a bill a Justin a Dan a Brian

a Tom and Andy

the idea that names might conjure

certain face shapes in our minds isn't

that strange for example there's

Wolfgang Kohler's famous finding that

when asked which of these shapes is

named buba and which is named Kiki

people of all different ages and

cultures and languages overwhelmingly

assign Kiki to the spiky one and buba to

the Blobby one and sure enough it

certainly seems to work with names too

which one of these men is Tim and which

is Bob

well almost unanimously people feel like

this is Tim and this is Bob

but are these men actually named Tim and

Bob

well there's the rub just because we

associate certain names certain sounds

with certain shapes doesn't mean we're

right

there's no such thing as a biological

name if a person still goes by the same

name they were given as a baby long

before anyone knew what they would look

like as an adult well surely there won't

be a connection

but as it turns out

there is

believe it or not in a multiple choice

setting people can guess a stranger's

name just by looking at their face more

often than we would expect from luck

alone it's called the face name matching

effect

here's a stimulus from zwebner's

research

this man is named Jacob Dan

Joseph

or Nathaniel

by just randomly picking a name people

should get this right 25 of the time but

zwebner found that people picked the

correct answer

Dan nearly 40 percent of the time

what's going on

can names actually cause us to grow to

look a certain way

well apparently they can it has been

called a Dorian Gray effect in Oscar

Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray a

portrait of the protagonist ages and

grotesquely reflects his evil Deeds

while he himself remains young and pure

looking in a similar way it seems that

in some cases our own appearance can

come to reflect the name we were given

but I kind of think it's really more of

a reverse story and gray effect I mean

in the book dorian's reality affects the

appearance of his portrait but the face

name matching effect goes the other way

a inanimate sign a name influences our

actual physical appearance

well anyway it's not news that a

person's name can lead others to have

certain expectations of them and treat

them accordingly it's been found for

example that multiracial faces given

European names are rated as looking more

European than the same faces are when

presented with non-european names

the expectations a name carries with it

may create a self-fulfilling prophecy

whereby as a person grows up they're

motivated to fulfill those expectations

carry themselves in ways people think

someone with their name should and even

like dislike accentuate hide use and

avoid different parts of their face and

body depending on whether or not those

parts match their name

it's been found that faces and names

that match are emotionally liked more

than faces and names that don't analysis

of voting data has shown that senatorial

candidates earn 10 more votes when their

names fit their faces very well then

when they fit very poorly now with that

in mind part of the effect could

literally come from the fact that

although parents don't know what their

kid will look like as an adult the

parents do know what they look like and

without knowing it tend to prefer names

that match their faces which are likely

to resemble their child's face as well

but not always

if the dissonance is too great a person

can always change their name either

completely or by simply choosing a

nickname if I had been just a little bit

different I Michael could have always

gone by Mike the fact that people can

adjust their names to fit them of course

merely strengthens the face name

matching effect

by studying whether the correct name

could be guessed when different parts of

a face were occluded researchers were

able to develop heat maps showing which

parts of the face different names are

most characteristically associated with

apparently looking like an an is all

about the tip of the nose it's the

bridge of the nose for Arthurs and the

philtrum or snot trough for Benjamins

aurelis are recognized by their face

spiders

let's go back to old people

how old is an old person

73.7 that's according to results

published in the Journal of American

geriatrics last year it's the average

age people gave when asked when does old

age begin

people under 65 on average said 71 and

people over 65 on average said 77. women

said old age began three years later

than men did white people said it began

eight years later than non-whites did

and people who felt healthy placed old

age later in life than those who felt

less healthy

but how old do people want to be

well that depends on how old they

already are in America the only people

who are the age they would like to be

are 21 year olds

well younger than 21 wish they were

older and people older than 21 wish they

were younger people who are 40 wish they

were 30 people who are 60 wish they were

40 and people who are 90 wish they were

60. when people are asked if they could

be one age forever the average American

picks 36 which is actually how old I am

right now funny enough

here's something else that's funny

old people are more likely to think they

dream in black and white

not because it's part of the aging

process but because they are veterans of

the great black and white dream epidemic

of the 20th century prior to the 1900s

Aristotle Descartes Freud everyone who

wrote about the topic reported that

dreams contained color

but as Humanity moved into the 20th

century the number of people reporting

color in their dreams dropped just as

quickly as the popularity of new black

and white movies and TV rows

by the 60s as color TV and movies became

more and more common reports of colored

dreams started going back up and today

people who grew up with black and white

TV continue to report more black and

white dreams than those who didn't and

later studies across China found the

same thing the frequency of black and

white dreaming correlated strongly with

how common black and white TV was in a

person's area

so did black and white movies and TV

literally change our dreams

well first of all it's not clear whether

dreams themselves actually changed or if

people just started thinking differently

about their dreams

we're trying but we still haven't found

a way to get direct access to dream

content

Eric's switchgeible has pointed out that

as far as we know dreams may not be in

color or black and white or sepia or

anything they may be primarily

indeterminate in color as they happen

and only later during recall do we

confabulate details about color he

Compares dreaming to reading is a novel

in color or black and white as you read

a story what do you see in your mind it

might be the case that dreams vaporous

as they are are something we simply have

a terrible grip on and that movies and

TV shows have given us the illusion of

understanding them in fact switchable

has speculated that smells and touch

Sensations are rare in dreams today but

future people with smelly touchy-feely

VR shows might think that they dream

with lots of textures and odors and find

it strange

maybe even frightening that few of us

seem to

but why would we think that dreams were

like moving pictures and not normal

Waking Life

well no one knows it might be that

motion pictures are just simply the

closest thing we have to dreaming that

isn't dreamy

unlike still images paintings

photographs tapestries Motion Pictures

and dreams can contain movement and

narrative and cause and effect and

unlike stage plays or real life Motion

Pictures and dreams are not made of

anything that is even remotely similar

to what they depict

they're both made of phantoms

images are uncanny things a person in an

image is Frozen in time but yet can seem

to grow old our own image can depend on

what we are called and they're the

closest thing we have to what our mind

does when we're away

do you get the picture

or does the picture get you

and as always

for watching
