hey Vsauce how are you guys doing today

I've got a treat for you I'm gonna be

counting down my favorite fake game

titles now I stole this idea from Jeff

and Adam but honestly Jeff lives in San

Francisco and the last thing he's gonna

do is come down here and see that I'm

stealing his ideas in fact while I'm on

the topic

Jeff is lame he's a loser and he smells

because he never learned how to wipe now

both of us are bowling but his baldness

is way ahead of mine so he could just

yeah dude like I was saying Jeff loved

him he's out here visiting I'm a big fan

of you by the way your hair looks great

thank you Thank You Leigh Jeff's out

here because of New York Comic Con 2010

we're all going to be there we're gonna

have some awesome stuff pretty exiting

from it and maybe even over the weekend

but while he's here we're going to do a

little casual fun thing we went through

and we came up with fake names for video

games that we would love to see made I

would love to see these games announced

at New York Comic Con this weekend hint

hint developers all right so let's get

to it

all right I've been playing a lot of

infamous lately but I said you know what

this doesn't have enough women and it

doesn't have enough balls so I am

proposing infamous pac-man

all right so instead of having to

collect those little battery shards you

know to increase your zapping amounts in

this one you actually just go walk out

all through the city collecting little

balls which is something that I love

doing just right in my mouth fight my

game that I'm really looking forward to

if they never make it as halo my darling

really sick in the future sending a halo

I'm looking for something with the 19:25

maybe some flappers maybe a singing and

dancing frog I love it I love it halo my

darlin halo my what you particularly I

am gonna have to say that I love fusions

I love when two games come together

Donkey Kong pong Donkey pong you know

your heads kind of Oh like I'm too like

I'm too high yeah well I think I'm a

really big fan of assassin

I think it'd be really cool if we had a

game what's called assassin speed and

you would just go around marking your

territory laying out the land yes I

heard that they are actually going to

announce that at whiz kaan oh yes a week

after Blizzcon yeah should be a good

time you've heard of Red Dead Redemption

but I hear Nickelodeon and Rockstar

joining forces to bring out Fred Dead

Redemption that's gonna be good

should be interesting oh this is a title

that I really think they should make

Star Wars the purse Unleashed just be

angry mother's just angry mothers and

particularly grandmothers that's like

bonus level you can also choose to play

with a murse if your grandfather or me

while we're on the topic of grandmothers

this is a title that I would really love

to see the develop Dead or Alive Senior

Center

it's just volleyball dentures and love

it you've always wondered what happened

to the do a girl's 30 years after the

fact now you know well you will know if

they make these games please if any

developers are out there and they like

these suggestions give us a call call

this number and you know well you know

will endorse it connect the balls is

going to be exciting yeah it really is

taking kinectimals to the next level and

just it's a virtual sack simulator you

ever play with cornstarch or made a fake

boob just imagine that with Kinect if a

strange teenagehood didn't you yeah I

kind of been a big fan of Castlevania on

my life you have to Michael Game Boy

Advance circle of the moon well I've

heard after lords of Shadow they're

coming out with a new game called

castlevania lords of eyeshadow it's

actually going to be the first part of a

trilogy all Twilight themed next one's

going to be Castlevania Bella's revenge

and the third one Castlevania werewolves

ate my sparkly nose so there you go

those are the titles we came up with

that we would love to see become real

games but here's my challenge to you in

the comments below leave a game that you

would like to see made especially one

with the funny title maybe it's a pun I

don't know be

creative and the title that we like the

most and vote them up thumbs them up if

you like I'm totally vote up the ones

that you like because the one that that

is is is voted up the most i will

actually yell out my love for you and

your usernames at Comic Con on Saturday

we'll have video proof of it and

everything and keep looking Friday we're

going to have another nerd wars this is

one of your suggestions for Vin Diesel

characters versus Stan Lee Marvel

character it's going to be awesome

ok thanks for watching guys have a great

day
