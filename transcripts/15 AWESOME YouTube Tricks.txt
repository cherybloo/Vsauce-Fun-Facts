Vsauce. Today we're gonna be covering a topic that is very close to my heart.

Clever uses of YouTube's technologies.

Now, I've always had a lot of fun messing around with stuff like the loading c...

circle and annotations.
But,

let's take a safari today through
things other YouTubers have done. Other

creative ways they've come up with using

what YouTube offers. Now obviously in this
one video we can't cover everything, so

please,

leave in the comments below other cool
things you found other YouTubers

doing. We're gonna start things off with Skittles' touch. These videos are pretty new,

but they let you physically get involved,
or at least with your

finger. I won't ruin the ending to that one,
but I also like the cage cop

version. Your finger helps fight crime.
By the way, there are links to all of these

videos for your own enjoyment

in the description. Back when YouTube
first supported widescreen, freddiew celebrated

by

interacting with the site itself.
He fought

and murdered the very letterboxing
surrounding him.

Joe Sabia has built a lot of really awesome clever things.

He's the guy who made the Oscar's 'Spot the
difference' video where you have to have a

eye

and find the differences and click the
answer to keep moving on

and on and on.
Joe also made this brilliant slot machine

where you have to click each wheel at just the right time

to complete a character.
MysteryGuitarMan was behind this

super creative interactive piano, where you could
make him play a song,

but I think the first person to explore
this fun idea was kokokaka

and play the piano.
In videos like these you have to let the whole

thing load and then you click on the actual piano keys

and they move you to the time code where that note is played.

I'm also a huge fan of this interactive
bass guitar because you can play the

notes

by just typing the numbers on your keyboard.
For instance, here I am using

this sequence to play a little song.

But let's stop playing around and get
narrative. There are a lot of great choose

your join adventure stories on YouTube,

but one of my favorites is Lego Spider,
where you help get a spider

off of your friend's head.
The music, by the way, is just incredible.

But if music and dancing is all you want,
go with the mixable dancer.

It's simple, but something about the costume and the dark background makes it

just crazy enough.

If you prefer magic, be sure to check out
the old classic YouTube magic card trick,

if you haven't already.

It was made back when YouTube first
implemented annotations.

The famous street fighter stop-motion
game from Patrick Boivin

was actually the inspiration behind my
Chris Brown punch out game. You have to

give it a try.

All of those idea used a lot of annotations,

but MysteryGuitarMan took it in a
different direction by including

hidden annotations in his videos that
viewers had to scavenger hunt to find

to get secret words.
Boone Oakley took it one step

even further.
They're an ad agency whose actual website

is a YouTube video. The links on the side here navigate you around and they even

have arrows hard-wired into the video

that show you where to drag the play-head to see specific things.

Now it's your turn.
Remember any fun tricks or

cool ideas that some other YouTuber did
that wasn't covered here? Well,

let us know in the comments below

or post those videos to Facebook.com/vsaucegaming.

I'm talking cool contests, nifty ways to get guys involved or just

other surprising uses of the
technology. I wanna see more of these things,

so let us now.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
