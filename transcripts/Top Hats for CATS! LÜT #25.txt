Star Wars splatter art and a t-shirt commemorating
one of history's most lapidary quotes.

It's episode 25 of LÃœT.

Navigate the web with glow-in-the-dark mouse

containing an actual spider.
And you can use a straw to drink juice right

out of a fruit, but this hand juicer turns
a fruit into a spray bottle for all your favourite

dishes.
Now go buy some top hats for your cat and

toast his style with a frothy beer that's
always foamy.

Japan Trend Shop brings us a gadget that with
a single click sends a rush of new bubbles

to the top.
You can say "I love you" in binary and then

snuggle up with your custom-made pillows.
PillowMob lets you upload a photo, crop it,

colour it, edit it and then receive a nice,
soft, cuddly, high-quality pillow, which is

apparently made by cats...?
Well, Neatoshop offers a unicorn-shaped pencil

sharpener, a beanie that makes you look like
a gory zombie, a soft, plush salami, ouchlets

for safety and a Tommy gun shaped purse.
I guess to carry around your spy video camera.

But you could be even more secret with a spy
camera hidden inside what looks like a phone

charger.
Evolution in New York sells a cute, stylised

tiger rug.
But if you have $3,000 and want a real animal

rug, they've got black bears, wolves and I'm
not kidding, zebras.

For a cool $12,000 you can get this.
Seriously.

I'm not lying.
Less real, but still macabre is this hollowed-out

skull USB hub.
You get 4 more ports and a skullball to keep

your stuff.
Similarly skeletory are these leg bones knee-high

socks, also available shorter, and Sock Theory
also has ones that lace up.

Happy socks and Converse shoes... socks.
Luna & Curious' animal mugs render each animal

half as a handle.
But if you're more interested in this end,

here's a coffee mug with a built-in secret.
As you sip away the Java, you reveal a perfect

little pile of poo.
When it comes poo at the office, avoid awkward

dumps next to your boss or dropped toilet
paper with this handy survival guide.

But in a worse-case scenario, make sure you've
got an emergency underpants dispenser.

Now, speaking of bathrooms, they are more
fun with giant googly eyes.

You can put these things on anything.
And they may not have meant it ironically,

but this book proves that dads are the original hipsters.

Of course, those gnomes and pink flamingos
they've got today... buy yourself a zombie

version for your own lawn.
And enjoy the sweetness of a 20-sided sucker.

The only luxury items more soothing are these
tequila ice pops, filled with real edible

gold flakes.
Now, your body can't really digest gold, so

save money and collect the flakes back after
sitting on your truck-hitched toilet seat-on-the-go.

In fact, why ever stop sitting?
These lazy football chairs let you try your

skills without working too hard.
Kick the ball with Kobi Levi's shark shoes

for him and her and illuminate the action
using a kit that helps you snap old light

bulbs into fun shapes around a new one.
Of course, why have real light when you can

have 8-bit light?
Painted on a canvas just for you.

Because then you can show your 8-bit life
with this necklace.

Or use one where the pendant swings on the
necklace, which is cute, but why the neck

a gemini?
Litter offers leg necklaces.

Well, they're guarder chains.
But here are some that attach to sunglasses

to give you a moustache.

The London underground, a razor blade or a

wiper blade to easily defog after a shower.
Oh and this one let's you compare your height

to celebrities.
Are you Snoop Dogg or Salvador Dali...?

...whose melting clocks could be yours with
this shelf clinking model.

It might be easier to just keep time on your
wrist with a watch made out of wood.

For every watch they sell the company plants a tree.

Now for your free thing, check out the wallpapers
Split Reason is offering.

I particularly enjoyed what the count must
see in the mirror.

And the simple fact that Particle physics
gives me a hadron.

Combine honeybees and boo to get boo-bees.

And always,

thanks for watching.
