welcome to the wack gamers yeah we're

gonna follow up our fall 2010 best games

video with a new video yes we thought

we'd focus on the games we don't really

want to buy the worst of the worst

coming out this fall and these aren't

fake these are real real real quick

couple of you mentioned Assassin's Creed

Brotherhood and call of duty black oops

Black Ops black goop's I just like black

ooze black ops coming out yes we are

sort of looking forward to them but we

just want to mention them because people

are harassing okay no they exist back

the terrible games terrible games

first up Deadliest Catch sea of chaos I

thought we were talking about bad games

are you [ __ ] serious

this is it that looks pretty good to me

you know it's not a stripper game where

you get crabs oh no you're on the low

yeah yeah this is the game where you

just pull in the tanks of crabs and then

offload them on and then at the end of

it the captain dies but but it's all to

a Bon Jovi soundtrack oh yeah i'ma catch

crabs yeah yeah that's kind of lost its

luster

yeah how many how many people you think

fall in the water yeah at least five

which is what gives the California rolls

the extra flavor which is so good you

can taste the death next game Karaoke

Revolution gali Edition that sounds

awful it's the game where you karaoke to

a show about a club that does karaoke

you it sounds like a game that my

girlfriend would force me to play

everyone to sing really bad covers of

songs that you used to like and and

don't anymore for good reason now you

can oh my goodness I don't care how much

you like Lee but just go buy those songs

in Karaoke Revolution I actually care

how much you like Lee I'm not shouldn't

not gonna pass value judgement no I'm

going to is it supposed to be funny I

don't get it I love that show anyway ow

next up Zumba Fitness it Zumba Fitness I

don't know can we stop making games

about being fit I'm playing video games

to ignore the fact that I'm fat yeah and

if I wanted to play a fitness game I

would play Wii Fit not I'm not a game

that requires the PlayStation Move

controller because nothing looks lamer

than doing aerobics with a lit wand he's

got a point that's what she said so I

would have to say probably the worst one

that's coming out is Yogi Bear the video

game

yeah yeah little late on the mark they

wanted to be clear that it wasn't the

cartoon it is Yogi Bear the video game

video game which I you know it's it's a

poignant time I wanted a video game

about a bear who is really based off of

the neighbor on The Honeymooners because

that's something kids can relate to

today it is that and the love of picnic

baskets and you know national parks

which we've also managed to get rid of

since Yogi Bear this it wasn't but is

there any reason to play this there's no

reason to make there totally is Yogi

Bear anyway those are our picks for the

worst games coming out this fall come on

Adam so yogi baby say goodbye to the

people
