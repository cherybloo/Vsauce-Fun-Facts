Vsauce on Wednesday a lot of you guys

were asking for a new episode of up all

night our technical pranks and

Curiosities show unfortunately these

guys are still on vacation but I'm going

to try to do this alone let's go to

begin you can break into locked luggage

just by poking it with a pen and polling

but let's get more digital to secretly

view websites while at work or school

you can use vanished. comom it covers

what you're doing with something

innocuous like google.com or a

spreadsheet but by scrolling your mouse

wheel up and down you can open and close

a little viewing window that lets you

take a peek at what you're really

viewing the next time one of your

friends leaves themselves logged into

Facebook click on account settings and

go into language now don't pick a weird

language pick something subtle like

English upside down now whenever they

log into Facebook and wherever they log

into Facebook some of the words will be

flipped another fun trick if your friend

has a Mac is to switch a simple keyboard

shortcut to something ridiculous for

instance let's make the keyboard

shortcut to invert colors command C that

way the next one tries to do something

simple like copy and paste this happens

and if you haven't seen it yet enter

your home's address into this Arcade

Fire HTML 5 video and see what happens a

few episodes ago we showed you some

JavaScript that lets you edit a website

but with Google Chrome you can take it

one step further the explanation for

this is kind of long but basically what

I can do is on my machine booby trap a

YouTube page so that when someone tries

to leave a comment YouTube tells them

that their past comments have violated

us criminal code and their name has been

submitted to the FBI pretty sweet crush

bits.com is a hilarious way to prank

your friends the site unfortunately has

a lot of popups so just close anything

that doesn't look like what you see on

the screen first type in your name I

don't know a fake birth date and an

email address I'm going to use Michael

from the office at mailinator.com

because you can just make up anything at

mailinator.com and get those emails

without needing a password and without

giving out your real email address now I

trade the code they give me to a friend

and tell them that the site is amazing

at determining if their secret crush

likes them so let's say I give it to

Jake and he says oh boy I don't want

anyone to know this but I have a crush

on Patty Smith Tarzan and the pink Power

Ranger well I hope no one finds out and

I hope this site tells me they like me

wait what my answers have been emailed

to Michael Stevens and sure enough I can

go to mailinator type in Michael Stevens

from the office and view the email with

no password and yep Jake admitted to

liking Patty Smith Tarzan and the pink

Power Ranger nice this next trick

requires Photoshop and is pretty

involved but it's fun to watch basically

I'm going to hide a message in a song

first I start with an MP3 this one is

the Key of Awesome's electronic wuss now

first I change its extension to R aw and

now I open the file with photosh shop or

some other image editor that supports

raw files I'll tell it to guess the

right size and TDA I get a visual

representation of all the digital

information in the song now I can write

my secret message the password is dony

pizza and then save as Photoshop raw now

I go back to this file and I can change

the extension back to MP3 so that when

people see it it plays just like normal

though in the Middle where the code is

it's creepy space alien messy

stuff I can trade This MP3 to friends

who know the secret and when they change

the extension back to raw and open in

Photoshop they get to see the code so

there you go a lot of those were super

technical but I hope you had fun be sure

to subscribe to Vsauce for more

information videos and as always thanks

for watching
