Vsauce today I've got more creativity

for you but not the kind you have to buy

or wait for these are 10 things you can

do online now guys

dawn sign minister 9 recommended a great

game where you have to jump to avoid

holes in the floor of course jumping

onto the walls makes them the new floor

a similarly cool perspective element is

found in sky island recommended by lil

Sputnik it begins as a classic 2d game

but then it gets difficult so you have

to use your mouse to click and drag the

reveal hidden dimensions and solve the

puzzles in ways that would be impossible

without three dimensions now let's get

some action gun blood is a game based on

the classic Western shootout you have to

hover your mouse over the barrel and

wait for the countdown then draw it's

kind of scary one of the most famous

games is powder game you can arrange

materials like a c4 box filled with

nitroglycerin with a fuse now many of

you have probably played it already

but if you'd like to play with gravity

instead of pressure try Aeon I found it

pretty difficult but basically all you

have to do is arrange gravity wells to

suck gas out of gas giants and pull it

into rings stabilize the exchange and

you win another game so famous I'm

afraid to mention it is line Rider now

you draw a line and then press play and

send a guy sliding down it but here is a

fun twist solid skier is a fast-paced

real time line Rider click anywhere and

bam you're drawing a skiers slope guide

him to checkpoints and give him little

quick hills to launch him into the air

if you prefer problem solving and

riddles you might like not pron this

game calls itself the hardest riddle

available on the Internet and with the

possible exception of Tim tank's test

it's probably right you'll have to super

think outside the box for this one each

puzzle is a picture with different types

of clues in a hidden solution for

instance look up here it says

look in the dark

hmm let's get cuter with little wheel

it's pretty much a point and click game

but the animation is beautiful and your

cute little robot guy has to get the

power back so his friends can function

finally a website suggested by kinda

semi-pro your world of text comm it's

like the cursor site I showed you last

week except with text you can see people

writing stuff and add your own in real

time you can even add a slash and a word

to create your own private world of text

for instance to find out what is missing

from this video go to your world of text

calm the slash Vsauce

now someone may have changed it or

deleted it by the time you get there but

hey that's the magic of the Internet
