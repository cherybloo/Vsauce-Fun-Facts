Iron Man hands down the winner you

Rosalie your Master Chief AHA is part of

an army

Iron Man works all by himself Master

Chief has some guns Iron Man has like 90

different suits all specialized Master

Chief pulls triggers Iron Man makes the

technology that makes the weapons were 2

words the flood two words scroll

invasion scroll visions nothing compared

to the flood nobody could stop the flood

except for Master Chief no man in a

frickin suit over technology that he

would have to sit in a lab for nine

months to devote all the Master Chief

has to do is come over to Iron Man in an

off day BAM dead done you know well the

discussion Master Chief's a badass

Master Chief has never made a bad

product and there's been terrible Iron

Man comic books mastered the Halo novels

are awesome you know they're not you

can't even talk with a straight face

I can't even say it with a straight face

to summarize Iron Man has the advantage

in technology intelligence and the

number of battles he's been in Master

Chief has the advantage of the future

the flood fighting the Covenant and not

ever not being master chief your your

points don't even they're not even point

yes they what Tony Stark could not kill

a covenant this is just stupid this is

stupid

he couldn't handle the fun you get

overwhelmed you know here are the

reasons I like Superman more Cape

kryptonite Smallville that's what you

just did things genius these are trashy

these are attributes that would make him

win in the fight unflappable you put the

two of them in a cage match no weapons

Master Chief's gonna walk out there the

winner Ironman has multiple different

types of armor he'd wear his Hulk armor

the armor that he uses to fight the Hulk

hand-to-hand combat style and he would

crush Master Chief like he was nothing

okay no technology no dogs out of their

suits Master Chief would win so now it

no now it's just the Jimmy nobody now

again

chief because that's not his name that's

not a name nobody named chief nope

nobody names a kid Master Chief that was

his birth name it's on the first ticket

I will go get it because I have a copy

of collector's edition copy of his you

you you go get that you go get that and

I will wipe my butt with that all right

because it's not real

unlike Tony Stark a real man a man for

tomorrow he likes him because he wants

to sleep with him mmm that's not true

here's nothing Tony Stark drunk drunk

half the time still kills everybody so

your sign with Tony Stark because he's

an alcoholic okay and he'll I win I

don't you die when you don't have a

single message chief not an alcoholic

Tony Stark alcoholic ding Master Chief

you know the sad thing that you do the

editing for this so I know at the end of

this is gonna just pop up Oh Master

Chief wins like right right there it's

right there I knew you'd do it Jeff why

did you do

Oh

ah
