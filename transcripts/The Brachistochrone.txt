hey Vsauce Michael here if every single

one of us held hands together in a chain

of unity around Earth would there be

enough of us to go all the way around

the planet there are about seven and a

half billion of us and that's a lot but

remember that that many human bodies

thrown together into one big pile would

barely fill the Grand Canyon this is all

of us in one place the physical bulk of

all living human flesh on earth today

would only make a cone about 7,000

people tall and 2,000 across that's it

but that's a three-dimensional shape

what if we made a one-dimensional

single-file line of people each with say

1 meter of room and we stretched that

around the planet well we would make it

all the way around and still have 99.5

percent of the human population left if

we made a circle that included everyone

the ring of people would be more than

2.4 million kilometers in diameter

dwarfing the orbit of our own moon now

that's not just a circle that is a sir

cool let's talk about circles today

specifically something that they do roll

but what is rolling well rolling occurs

whenever something moves with respect to

something else and is always in contact

with that something else and the contact

points have instantaneous velocities of

zero that is there's no sliding in

mathematics the path traced by a point

on a rolling object is called a roulette

French four little wheel the centre of a

disk produces a roulette that's just a

smooth straight line while rolling on

one

and this is why disks are good wheels a

square on the other hand would be bumpy

but square centers can make straight

smooth Roulettes

across the right surfaces this is the

principle behind square wheels which I

recently had the pleasure of enjoying at

the Museum of mathematics in New York

City Stan wagon wrote a fantastic and

famous article about wheels which I've

linked down in the description below

it's a great read he also contributed a

fantastic interactive tool to the

Wolfram demonstration project that

allows you to build a wheel and then

find the corresponding road shape that

allows it to roll smoothly the roulette

traced by a point on a disk as it rolls

on a straight line has a special name

it's called a trochoidal Greek word for

real TRO Coase now trochoidal prolate

depending on whether the tracing point

is inside or outside the circumference

if the point is on the circumference the

resulting curve is called a cycloid

cycloids are very special and they are

the star of this episode now I've been

working with Adam Savage a lot lately as

we gear up for brain candy live our 40

city tour that I hope to see you at

recently I asked Adam for some help with

rillettes Adam give a favorite polygon

you can't they're like your children you

got a favorite eye I don't have a

favorite either I do have a favorite

thing that you can do with the polygon

okay make a cyclic on a cyclic cyclic on

is an actual actual thing it's an actual

thing do have a polygon around here

here this this here's a squid right

right say this is a square yeah

if I take one of the vertexes of this

squid and I start rolling this square

and you follow where that vertex oh

shoot

let me roll this better are you ready

yeah all right the actual path

it describes a curve described here yeah

that curve is called a cyclic on and as

you pick polygons with more and more

sides you get closer and closer to what

I want from you today okay a cycloid a

cycloid now I I could have just done

this in Photoshop and done like an

animation like I normally do but you

have a shop we can actually build and

you can build the bit okay why did I

want to build a cycloid well let me ask

you this with only gravity to move you

what's the fastest way to roll or slide

from a point to some other point below

but not directly below would it be a

straight line well that would certainly

be the shortest path but when you fall

gravity accelerates you and falling

vertically a lot right away would mean

having a higher top speed during more of

the journey and that can more than make

up for the fact that a path like this is

much longer than a straight line but of

these two considerations accelerate

quickly and don't have too long of a

path what's the optimal combination

finding the answer the path of least

time is called the brick east a chrome

problem and it's been around for a while

Galileo thought the answer was a path

that's just a piece of a circle but he

was wrong there's a better one and in

1697 Johann Bernoulli came up with the

answer using a very clever approach to

see how he solved it let's start with a

similar problem you are standing in some

mud and you want to run to a ball in the

street as quickly as possible now a

straight line would be the path of

shortest distance but if you can run on

pavement much faster than you can run in

mud the path of shortest time would be

one in which you spend less time moving

slowly in mud and more time

on the surface your bast on the angle

you should enter the pavement at depends

on how fast you move on both surfaces as

it turns out when the ratio between the

signs of these two angles equals the

ratio between your speeds across both

surfaces the resulting path will be the

optimal quickest route this is called

Snell's law light always obeys Snell's

law when it changes speeds like when it

leaves a material in which it moves more

slowly like water and enters one in

which it moves more quickly like air it

always refract according to Snell's law

in other words light always follows the

route that is the fastest for it to take

Bernoulli used this fact to tackle the

brick ista chrome problem light changing

speed is analogous to a falling object

changing speed but of course a falling

object doesn't just speed up once its

speed is always increasing its

accelerating to mimic this using light

which Bernoulli knew would always show

him the fastest possible route all he

had to do was add more and more thinner

and thinner layers in which the speed of

light was faster and faster and faster

and well what do you know there it is

the brick East a chrome curve the path

of least time roll down a track like

this and you will beat anything rolling

down any other path every time Bernoulli

was clever enough to realize that this

curve can be described in another way as

a roulette specifically he noticed that

it was a cycloid the path traced by a

point on a circle rolling along a line a

cycloid satisfies Snell's law everywhere

to see why I highly recommend watching

this video on the brick East a chrome

problem this channel is fantastic by the

way I'm a huge fan the visuals and

explanations are top-notch anyway a

cycloid provides the perfect balance

between keeping the journey distance

short and picking up speed early now I

told Adam all of this

and I told him that it would be really

fun to have a cycloid curve we could

roll things down and he said clearly we

should start building we should just

start building it what we need is a

circle okay that's a the height that we

want mm-hmm and then we're going to use

that circle to trace a night cycloid

curve I want to do a race right so yeah

yeah look if we're gonna do like if you

have point a here and point B here and

you say that there's some kind of curve

that's better than a straight line in

terms of something traveling between

those two then I want to also make a

straight line from A to B yeah and maybe

also a really extreme curve like that

right okay got some protractors there

you have a compass extension I do I have

all sorts of I've never seen such thing

is that it yeah that connects to that

give or take I almost am I feel guilty

that this is like a dream of mine coming

true oh really but it's such a nerdy

dream too it's not like I want this you

know Red Ryder BB gun it's like I just

want to curve that things roll down

okay so then clearly when we're done

with this this is this is my Christmas

present to you

I think I'm currently like working out a

way to do this in my head that actually

makes it fairly compact and not super

not super complicated yeah take a blade

and cut out like an inch around the

whole thing

[Music]

how are you gonna do the finishing I'm

going to cut this unless you would like

to on the band's you can start okay

[Music]

okay now that's a little bit rough so

we're gonna finish it on my disc sander

oh wow

that's close enough it's pretty good

yeah so now you want to use this to draw

a psych psych Lloyd yeah so you'll need

a little hole that's what yeah so that

the point of our drawing implement is on

the rim not above it I'm doing this

right inside I don't think so it is

that's even better than having the rim

hole because we want the line to be

right on the edge okay so what we're

gonna do is we're gonna create a pattern

for the cycloid curve that I'm then

going to transfer to acrylic to clear

acrylic regular right allow us to see

things really clearly yeah this allows

you right roller sight because we're

just doing it it's literally like that

right oh yeah see this is perfect yeah

pushed against here I shouldn't slip

this is like a Ouija board for geometry

nerds

it is a Ouija board for geometry nerds

okay there we go

that's smooth out Ricci stack rone

that's that's that's the curve that

we're talking about yeah that's the

beginning that's the end and this is our

pattern yeah cool that's cool

okay so I'm gonna end up with let's say

3/4 of an inch thick but it's gonna have

channels table saw it out of it mm-hmm

travel its length and in those channels

will sit my clear acrylic acrylic curves

and it'll also have an upright

that also will have the channels milled

out of it on the table soft and that'll

allow the curve to sit and be supported

yeah a little backstop here easily at

the bottom that will allow us to hear

that they all hit at the same time

there's a couple things going on one is

is that we've got cycloid straight line

and then we've got extreme curve right

and are these you had mentioned bending

the acrylic so we could adjust the no

magically I have this is you like this

the acrylic will just be a thin of

acrylic just a thin sheet of it

traveling on that will be and I have

material for this some Delrin or acetyl

rollers that look like this so from the

side they'll look like this they'll look

like an H ah huh in which the acrylic

sits in there and the roller is

self-supporting on the acrylic but rolls

down

ah that is tolerance love it

I like those curves while Adam and I

build a real-life cycloid track let's

take some time to appreciate other kinds

of Roulettes as mentioned before

trochoidal anon straight lines but an

epitome oi is made when a disk rolls

around the outside of a circle roll a

disk inside a circle and what you've

made is a hypo trochoidal names for the

curves you make when using a spirograph

toy notice that the holes don't lie on

the circumference of the disks though

some do come close there's a special

name for epic rock woods and hypo

trochoidal

an algis to disks rolling on straight

lines they are epicycles and hypo

cycloids now if two circles have the

same radius a point on the rolling one

will touch the stationary one exactly

once always in the same spot creating a

cusp this cute heart-shaped epicycle ID

is also known as a cardioid if the

rolling circle has half the largers

radius you'll get a 2 cusped epicyclic

the shape of which is called a nephrite

because it apparently looks like a

kidney I guess 1/3 the radius gives you

three cusps 1/4 four cusps and so on as

for hypo cycloids if the inner circles

radius is 1/4 of the larger x' the

resulting Roulette curve is called an

asteroid because it looks like a star

which the ancients also thought about

asteroids 1/3 the radius and you've got

a deltoid named after its resemblance to

the Greek letter Delta 1/2 the radius

and well you get a straight line this

fun relationship is called a 2 C couple

rotational motion turned into linear

motion follow a number of points on the

rolling circle and you'll get the famous

illusion where every individual point

moves in a straight line but the whole

thing describes a rolling circle put a

handle on it

and you've built a trammel of Archimedes

aka an ellipse a graph when used to

ellipses AKA a hillbilly entertainment

center

when bought in Osceola Missouri anyway

let's get back to Adam and eyes curve

comparison build okay okay there's your

finish line you ready I'm ready

all right I'll count us down three two

one go okay here we go

3 2 1 go 1 2 3 with the asleep was

second straight was last straight was

last the shortest distance between two

points was last slowest way to get there

yeah it certainly was let's try it one

more time yep because it was super close

the brick ista Crone curve was by far

the winner yeah what a mouthful of a

name by the way barista drunk East uh

Crone but Keith's brick east across not

related to the brachiosaur looked at our

that's I once looked up the difference

between ingenious and ingenuity and they

don't have them and they're not related

no all right now ready I'm ready

3 2 1 go

yeah same results same result

1 2 these are so close it's hard to tell

[Music]

well we're answering the main question

which is that the barista chrome curve

is the fastest way to get there well a

brick easter chrome curve is also known

as a tata chrome curve that has another

property that's that we should test

what's it and that is it's all you know

hold up before you get to this we've

established between these three curves

that the cycloid made brick easter

chrome curve is by far the fastest it's

by far the fast okay great you get steep

and unfortunately you pick up a lot of

speed right away but then you've got a

lot of this with little acceleration yep

you go straight down and you know funny

enough you what you want is that perfect

balance of gravities acceleration but

also moving to where you need to be and

that is asked that's fascinating to me

that a geometry which is the cycloid

curve would yield such an efficient

exploitation of the forces involved yeah

exactly

because if there was no acceleration if

there was just one force in the

beginning straight-line would probably

be the fastest right okay what is the

other quality of the Tata chrome curve

you just said it

Tata chrome means same time so as the

geometry and math tells us no matter

where you start an object yeah

what whoops the clamp city it was my

fault but also come on clamp no it

sector you know how to do these tables

are a pain in the ass because they have

these lips on them and they actually

that's like it's it's actually my fault

so I'm gonna remove the straight line

guy as well so we're left with a cycloid

which is called a brick East a Crone

curve but it also has a bizarre property

where no matter where I start an object

on it when I let go they always reach

the bottom in the same amount of time

wait a second so if I started here the

amount of time it takes for this to get

to the end

is the same amount of time it takes for

it to get to the end from here

yeah and the same from right here well

Wow okay so starting from here it's

gonna be tough because of friction yeah

now if you do this in software it's

perfect but that's boring yeah this is

the real world and maybe we won't start

the network I mean if we do one two and

three yeah are we actually I feel like

we could probably we could probably get

one to work from here like that there

might be a lot of friction involved but

look at always see we can always see

we've got enough of them that's why we

made three curves so we can test this

property and these were all cut and

sanded clamped together so they are

incredibly similar I will have to tamper

the edge as I did on this one yeah a

little known fact that once you've torn

paper off of Plexiglas it crumples into

a really nice wall to be thrown long

distances a Plexiglas in the first place

I've never seen it happen because it

doesn't really feel glued I think this

is I hope that's cool because in theory

and practice theory in theory theory and

practice are the same thing but in

practice I went to the University of

Chicago where one of their sings

well that sounds good in practice how is

it in theory hahahaha life of the mind

there so let us see if you do if I do

one up here and you do one there and

okay yes so this has got to be without

this I think the same person should

release them because then okay I'm it

better so here put that one here okay

all right so three different positions

three this one has longer to go yep this

one has the shortest path so who's gonna

reach the bottom first okay here we go

let's see would you wish it would say

the one in might this one yeah go first

ready yeah good pretty good that was

awesome that was so they all ended up

they lined right up alright let's do

let's let's switch it up okay even I

think you're gonna be the one to release

them yeah otherwise it won't be easy to

time here we go three two one I'd be

garnish them lining up yeah they line up

like they're waiting for each other I'm

gonna stand further away cuz I want to

see the full path okay ready yeah three

two one how cool is that they totally

line up to hit at about the same

periodicity they went for here so given

the vagaries of some extra frictions

here and there there they're actually

hitting this at the same sort of

periodicity that they are when they

start at the same point so there's that

and then

[Music]

is this some is this the Tata chrome

curved demonstration ring of your dreams

it really is it is it's also the brick

Easter Kron rig of my dreams and the

cycloid rig of my dreams so check that I

keep doing that yeah that is really cool

another one yeah that was yeah exactly

on point Wow

raesha see in this game no matter where

you start no matter who you are you're

always a winner there's always a tie so

this is brain candy for me Adam toasties

this is something that was previously

abstract and only seen in animations and

in text made real now I can put these

wherever I want I'm not stuck with what

someone else did I can physically hold

it and that's that's what makes brain

candy exciting for this it is like that

I love taking the theoretical and making

it physical and actually honestly we've

always had what seemed to me like sister

enterprises yeah and it's nice to join

them together yeah this is this is a

little child of ours isn't it maybe

maybe one of us wasn't so good at

sanding and maybe the other of us kind

of saved the day but it's real now yeah

and it's alive and I think it's loving

its life that was fun it was really fun

true Adam thank you so much for your

help

working with you is always amazing I

hope to see all of you out there

watching at brain candy live it's going

to be incredible and in your daily lives

may you always find the Tata chrome the

solution that brings you and others

together even if you started in

different places

and as always thanks for watching
