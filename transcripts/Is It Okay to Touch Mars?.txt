hey Vsauce Michael here no rocks from

Mars have ever been brought back to

earth and no human has ever touched

anything on Mars but that's about to

change National Geographic has asked me

and Jake and Kevin to talk about Mars

because they have a show coming out soon

all about how we are planning to turn

Mars into a home a place where humans

will soon be living and working it's a

plan set to become a reality in the

2030s that's cool but beyond just how

there are everyday life questions raised

we would be literally beginning society

all over again on a new planet whose

laws will Martian colonists follow what

kind of watches clocks and calendars

will they use and what will be lost if

we as a species gain Mars is it okay to

touch Mars what will its flag look like

in 1998 Pascal Lee designed a flag for

Mars that was flown at the hotend Mars

project research station where how

humans might live and work on other

planets was studied the flag is a nod to

Kim Stanley Robinson's famous red Mars

free Mars and blue Mars trilogy should

we have the technological and political

ability to do so at some point in the

future we could terraform Mars from a

red planet into a green with life and

then blue watery earth-like one this

flag has since been used by a number of

Mars exploration societies and was even

flown into space aboard space shuttle

Discovery by astronaut John Grunsfeld

in 1999 that all makes it a pretty good

contender to be the first official flag

of Mars the Outer Space Treaty of course

prohibits national appropriation of

celestial bodies

it doesn't necessarily stop private

individuals or companies from doing so

but since it takes months at best to

actually go between Earth and Mars and

minutes to even communicate at

Lightspeed

how would and who would enforce laws on

Mars

if Martian colonists did things that we

here on earth disagreed with what can we

do to pressure them otherwise or punish

them for being criminals one idea

extraterrestrial Liberty is to just give

up control and release those headed to

Mars from all current earth-based laws

their nationalities hold them to to

allow them to become Mars citizens able

to make laws elect live and die the way

they want free from any currently

existing state that might be reasonable

but it raises another question when when

is Mars now what time is it there for

colonists on Mars an earth watch would

be of very little help a day on Mars the

time it takes the planet to turn around

once sunrise to sunrise is about 2.7

percent longer than on earth I mean

that's pretty close but over time it

adds up gradually an earth watch on Mars

would drift and the time it said would

tell you very little about night and day

on the Red Planet to combat this

scientists on earth who work with

robotic Rovers on Mars use Mars time

they actually live by it you can

download a program that tells you solar

times on Mars or do what many scientists

have done get yourself a watch that runs

2.7 percent slower than usual if every

second every minute is 2.7 percent

slower than it should be it'll be

perfect for matching Mars's rotation

that could spell trouble for Martian

colonists though who wish to tune into

live events on earth like sports sort

award shows but again given the immense

travel time between the two Earthlings

and Martians may find that having

similar timekeeping systems just

really that necessary in their everyday

lives okay right now on earth it is 2016

as we know one trip through all the

seasons from now will have been a year

but in that same time Mars will have

only traveled part of the way through

its seasons

if Martian colonists continue to use

earth years that's okay but it would

mean that for them years would feel a

bit arbitrary they wouldn't contain

environmental cycles like ours do

perhaps if they feel disconnected and

emancipated from earth calendars they'll

just use their own Martian year system

as well a few such calendars have been

proposed some divided into familiar week

and month lengths but with about twice

as many of each per year the thing

however that fascinates me most about

putting humans living things on Mars is

a more touching topic literally humans

will likely touch the red planet in our

lifetimes and the first to do so will be

famous but jokes on them I mean we me

you we're all already touching Mars let

me ask you this where did you get that

body that one you're in right now it's

made of atoms and molecules but they

come and go you eat and breathe and

absorb things use them for a while but

eventually shed or exhale or otherwise

pass them through a month from now your

skin will be completely different skin

all new cells the red blood cells you've

got now we'll only be with you for about

another four months like a water wave

you're a temporary arrangement of stuff

a really neat thing that dirt does but

not all of this dirt that you are the

dust in from dust to dust is earth dirt

new stuff is always falling to earth

anywhere from five thousand to three

hundred thousand kilograms of space rock

dust debris asteroid fragments that

a some of which inevitably winds up

being you part of your body for a while

now that may sound like a lot of

material but compared to the mass of

earth it's small some of these et rocks

are debris that's been floating around

our solar system since the planets

formed some has come from asteroid

collisions some has even come from

interstellar space beyond our solar

system what's neat is that because atoms

and molecules are so small even the tiny

amount of interstellar material landing

here adds up to a lot at the atomic

scale ask a physicist estimated that if

only 0.01% of all the extra-terrestrial

material falling to earth comes from

beyond our solar system and even if only

10% of that stuff is water that would

still mean that 50 billion 5 0 billion

with a beam of the water molecules in

your body right now as you watch this

video we're in interstellar space fewer

than 1,000 years ago

some of the space material falling to

earth comes from planets like Mars when

powerful enough impacts occur on its

surface

Martian material can reach escape

velocity and begin an interplanetary

journey rarely but occasionally this

journey terminates on earth it's been

estimated that Martian meteorites only

fall to earth about once every 50 years

or so that's a long time in human years

but in Planet years that's nothing your

physical body right now

likely contains billions of atoms that

used to be on Mars and arrived here on

earth in the last 1,000 years if you

consider stuff from Mars that's been

here on earth for less than a millennium

as being Martian well it's tenable to

say that you are point zero zero zero

zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero

zero zero zero zero one percent Martian

but before you get too excited there's a

difference between Martian debris that

was roasted and exploded in our

atmosphere centuries ago and actual

still on Mars material

the difference might be small or it

might be big when Apollo 11 astronauts

returned from the moon they didn't

splashdown and then run into the arms of

family members instead they were locked

away in quarantine for three weeks

just in case the moon harbored any kind

of previously unknown or unthinkable

life-form an organism or virus that

could have come back to earth with them

one that earth life had never

encountered and thus never been

naturally selected to resist the threat

of a moonbug pandemic wiping out life on

Earth was just large enough that NASA

took precautions though later Buzz

Aldrin admitted on Twitter that their

quarantine facility wasn't perfectly

sealed luckily no moon germs escaped and

infected all earth life probably because

there weren't any to begin with after

Apollo 14 the moon quarantine

requirement was lifted because it had

become

sufficiently clear that the moon was

devoid of life but Mars well we still

don't know exactly

we haven't found macroscopic life on

Mars but the possibility of tiny things

hasn't yet been ruled out and the

incredible consequences contamination

could have means it remains a serious

concern there's even an advocacy group

of scientists from all over the world

called the International Committee

Against Mars sample return but it's not

just bat contamination that matters the

transfer of extraterrestrial organisms

to earth

there's also forward contamination the

transfer of earth organisms to things in

space any light that might currently

exist on Mars could be incredibly

vulnerable to things we here on earth

barely notice but accidentally bring

there how sad would it be to one day

find life on Mars

only to realize that it's all dead

everything it had to teach us about

itself about Mars about the solar system

about life wiped out just a few years

ago by a virus stowed away unbeknownst

to us on one of our robotic missions

extremophiles organisms have been found

that may be able to survive such a trip

life here on earth may have even arrived

from space in that way a concept called

panspermia so should we be scared of

monsters beyond our atmosphere I'm

reminded of the glowworm in their larval

stage the glowworms stick to the tops of

caves and leaves usually above water

sources their glow resembles the night

sky the tempting expanse of other worlds

beyond our own like us bugs are

attracted to this Vista believing it's a

way out of the cave of course it's not

the glow worms dangle sticky mucus

strings from their perches snares that

capture

their prey are the real stars no

different a clever trap that keeps alien

predators fed probably not but that

hasn't stopped space agencies like NASA

from forming divisions like their office

for planetary protection a group that

oversees plans for missions that might

bring earth and alien life into contact

currently all missions to Mars must

satisfy the Coleman Sagan equation this

sterilization restriction works to

ensure that the probability of us

contaminating places like Mars with

foreign earthly organisms is not zero

but at most one in 10,000 that was

considered acceptable given the number

of Mars missions we probably do before

fully understanding its exobiology so

far we have no evidence that anything is

alive on Mars right now or has ever been

but that brings us to Anne's met the

Antarctic search for meteorites an

effort that since 1976 has found more

than 20,000 extraterrestrial rocks in

Antarctica the first one they found in

Allen Hills in 1984 was special for one

thing it's believed to have originated

on Mars it's estimated that about 17

million years ago this piece of rock was

blasted off the surface of Mars by a

meteor and reached terminal velocity

about 5 kilometers per second fast

enough to leave Mars entirely after

flying through space for a very long

time 13,000 years ago it got captured by

Earth's gravity and fell to our planet's

surface 12 years after its discovery the

presence of what looked like microscopic

fossils were discovered on the rock

could they be evidence of Martian life

the claim didn't convince everyone but

to this day the structures exact origins

haven't been explained how exactly to

tell whether they're caused by living

things isn't agreed on either but the

finding was a major event in the field

of astrobiology and the public's

understanding of it

the discovery was possibly so momentous

that US President Bill Clinton gave

remarks about it saying today Rock 84001

speaks to us across all those billions

of years and millions of miles it speaks

of the possibility of life if this

discovery is confirmed it will surely be

one of the most stunning insights into

our universe that science has ever

uncovered after his statement these are

the two questions he was asked by the

press did he believe abortion rights

were under attack and where did he get

his tie the thing is alien nano bacteria

don't wear ties they don't legislate or

govern us or control our lives or look

anything like us if they exist will most

likely be in control of them and

probably actually not even notice them

under our boots

so does protecting or preserving them

not matter I mean should should we just

not let them get in the way of our

progress as a species well that's a

fundamental question that touches upon

what we want our purpose to be in this

universe labeling parts of Mars

don't touch as parks would be a great

way to preserve it as it was before we

came so that our grandchildren and their

children can see what Mars was like for

well most of human history others have

argued that we shouldn't go at all that

Mars is best left to itself

humans ruin things and what right do we

have to alter Mars if we can help

ourselves still others say why stop at

natural parks if we find viable life on

Mars that may be struggling to survive a

rare relic perhaps from a time when Mars

was more hospitable to life they argue

that we should help change Mars so that

those remaining Martian organisms can

thrive and multiply and be their best

selves with our technology intelligence

and sapiens we perhaps alone in the

solar system have the power to help them

and we should help ourselves to Mars

second these aren't just hypothetical

philosophical problems by the way with

plans for manned missions to Mars just a

bit under two decades away their

questions we will actually need to

answer quite soon should humans go to

Mars it would be a great way to spread

out to diversify our habitats so we're

still around should anything happen to

earth and of course it does give us more

space for more people but for what

ultimately Jupiter doesn't care if there

are seven billion humans or seven

trillion the volcanoes of Io

will continue erupting whether or not we

write anymore poems about love if humans

were wiped out today the fundamental

forces of the universe wouldn't change

and distant galaxies would continue

their journeys into the abyss beyond the

observable universe just as they already

are and always will what good is life to

the universe perhaps it has none

but we are possibly its greatest and

only hope to find out we may not treat

life as well as we could but whatever

this darn life thing is keeping it

around might very well be up to us we

owe it at least that much and as always
