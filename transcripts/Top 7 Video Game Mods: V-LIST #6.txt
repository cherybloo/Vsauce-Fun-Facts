how's Vsauce doin Michael here and today

I'm talking mods not console mods though

this guy who just freakin microwaved his

ps3 deserves an honorable mention

instead I'm talking about modifications

of games I'm gonna start with grand

theft auto

not the car gun but this vehicle mod

that gives Nico a skateboard and here's

a combination of the two games I've

dedicated most of 2010 to World of

Warcraft models in Starcraft 2 notice

the health bars in the click to move

love it let's rewind to mid - I couldn't

find any video of this mod in action but

it represents a history nerd angle that

I love it's called blue vs. gray no not

red vs. blue blue vs. grey and it allows

you to fast-forward the game from

medieval times to the American Civil War

how about this body Mass Effect 2 so

that Shepherd is a girl see it's a nice

equal-opportunity mod of course it also

allows famous scenes like this to become

well different the original Unreal

Tournament was the first game I played

secretly without parental approval point

is I love this mod of the ps3 version of

Unreal Tournament 3 it lets you play as

halos masters but why stop there the

more layers of modern is the better so

why not put halo 3 in Unreal Tournament

and then stick the whole thing inside a

side-scrolling Super Mario Brothers game

this is like digital turducken while

we're talking Super Mario here it is a

first-person game with a map made in

half-life 2 not enough freedom well

let's put Mario in Vice City the mod

that impresses me the most is this

Simpsons map for quake 3 it's super

famous because the attention to detail

is incredible and it doesn't stop with

the interior of the house either so

that's my list there are so many other

great mods out there I would love to

hear back from you guys tell me what

your favorites are and let us know where

we can get them and/or see them in

action

these aren't mods at all they're just

people doing what the game is for but

that are neat enough I had to include

them you know things like this luxury

vehicle from LittleBigPlanet

this guy who's building a working 16-bit

arithmetic computer inside minecraft yes

he's building a computer inside a video

game on his computer wants something

bigger well how about this guy he's

building a one to one scale model of the

enterprise in Minecraft yes that's right

one to one actual size he's got the

entire frame finished but he's looking

for people to help him finish the Dex

you can check him out in his channel by

following a link in this video's

description I've also put links to all

of these mods in action there stay tuned

Friday for a special countdown for Mikey

gamer of the top fall games until next

time thanks for watching
