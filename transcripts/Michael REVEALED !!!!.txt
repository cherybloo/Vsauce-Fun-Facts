hey Vsauce Michael here and I'm flying

to Dallas today to see my sister but

until then I thought it might be fun to

show you a handful of the over 200

videos I made before Vsauce that way you

can get to know me a little bit more

intimately the first video I ever made

was actually for a class in college it

was a mash-up of two movies Ferris

Bueller's Day Off and Friday the 13th I

also made this rap video mashup starring

george w bush and karl rove next i moved

on to making complicated artistic

cultural pieces on a new channel

campaign 2008 such as this masterpiece

hillary clinton farts you often avoid

taking firm positions on controversial

issues

I didn't have a girlfriend my senior

year of college so I spent the time

teaching myself editing techniques while

making Obama sing like a Bollywood star

for my video Barack Obama would but love

was still in my heart and that's why I

edited this video where I made it look

like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton

kissed

I also cut Mitt Romney to do an old

episode of Gilligan's Island and made it

look like he was creeping on the girls

around that time I started doing work

for barely political editing and re

mixing my own stuff and even some stuff

by other people like the songs by Mark

Douglas I also got to revisit Hillary

Clinton's gastrointestinal problems this

time with a cameo by John McCain hello

when the election was over I summarized

it in a remix built out of the original

Mario Brothers you can see Obama take on

pundits and even score himself at Joe

Biden power up when YouTube introduced

annotations I was there and in March of

2009 I built an interactive Chris Brown

punch-out game across 30 different

videos on barely arcade in the game you

can choose to throw things at him to

score points like of course burning dog

poop a few months and dozens of remixes

later I started editing compilation

videos along with music from Jake shut

now like this one where I counted down

my 51 favorite kid fails I also played

bass guitar with rusty in his world of

warcraft inspired van Ford Zeppelin

and before he was doing auto-tune the

news I directed and edited a few videos

with Michael Gregory there's good old

Jake there's Andrew and here I come

riding on a space lock and late this

year I was still being like this video

where I made it look like Obama was

smoking the natural next move of course

was to make Justin Bieber's head explode

and while Tom small was on vacation I

directed and edited electronic was for

the kiosk to tickle my butt cheeks a nun

flies through the sky but here's the

news story Vsauce 2 that's right before

the sauce completely overflows on one

channel I've started the second channel

holidays but you can go over there right
