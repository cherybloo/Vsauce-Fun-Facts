Vsauce happy almost Halloween to

celebrate I'm going to show you my top

six favorite flash games to get me into

the Halloween spirit and you can play

them too I've got links in the

description so without further Ado let's

turn down the lights and get started at

number six I've got the cell in this

game you have to find items and come up

with creative ways to use them to

progress what's super creepy about the

game though isn't just the location an

ambient noise but the fact that your

character only speaks backwards and

whenever you get a phone call it sounds

like this CH three

get number five these next few games are

pointand click games mostly ones where

you have to find a way to escape first

the house horror this one is really

mysterious you fumble around clicking on

different things seeing what happens and

hoping to make sense of all the strange

clues for instance clicking certain

people in this creepy drawing causes

things to momentarily change the only

thing that's really clear right off the

bat is that something very terrible

happened here number four x mortise this

point- and click also puts you in a

terrifying house one that you find

yourself in after waking up for reasons

unknown in the middle of the woods the

artwork and music are super creepy and

it's fun to poke around hm nothing in

the cabinets but what about this

microwave dripping blood let me just

open it real

quick the same guy behind X mortise also

made number three purgatorium this game

is about figuring out how to escape from

a room while also learning about the

dark event that occurred in it as always

be sure to look really closely at number

two we leave the pointand click

Adventures for bright in the screen

What's creepy about this online game is

the fact that you learn the rules as you

play and usually only moments before

it's too late you have to avoid the

crazy red guys and click black boxes to

see what lies Beyond if you don't you

might be surprised by what's there or

not there and at number one is a game

I'm really impressed by closure in this

game the plane space is completely dark

except for the light coming from a globe

you carry around the artwork is

fantastic and really twisted great for

playing in the dark but here's what's

super cool anything not touched by your

light doesn't exist you can use this to

your advantage and hop through walls or

fall through floors that the light made

real so there you go
