superheroes versus videogame characters

The Incredible Hulk vs. King Koopa

here's my reason why Cooper would win

sure the Hulk is big and strong Cooper's

not really strong he's just big but he

could shoot fireballs and the Hulk is

not immune to fireball

okay says Jeff who's wrong but let's say

let's even imagine let's imagine that

fireballs could hurt the Incredible Hulk

okay they would they would they let's

just imagine they were let's imagine

that they would happen and let's let's

even let's even get rid of the fact that

that would just make the Incredible Hulk

mad which makes him more powerful let's

just talk about this number of short

Italian men who killed the Incredible

Hulk zero fam nobody's killed Koopa he

keeps coming back he keeps coming back

like a rubber band at the barn

ring I'm back every time comes back a

lot - I'm saying incredible only back

once ass okay once more they really come

back he rose but that's all another

issue that came back he was dead Holly

 he was high and I said highs okay

guys oh I'm like JC and dude JC here was

like I'm just saying a King Koopa

wouldn't even stand chance he can't even

keep a woman in his castle a Ally

Sheedy fireballs

alright in Mario Kart he's one of the

slowest Mario is actually what do we get

immune to frickin fireballs oh he's not

can't push Koopa off the track okay the

lobby you can't push I bought that

this one's at I know what girl time it's

not know I had at I know if this is

stupid

he's right powerful person in the Marvel

Universe he Koopa wouldn't even last a

minute you just saying this to piss its

high you're just trying to piss me off

no I think all right next fireballs

versus strength anyway here we go we're

gonna poop what can hide he just crawls

into his shell he can't hide this is

what pulls us arms in the Incredible

Hulk would rip the shell apart like it

was paint because it'd be fireballs

spitting out of it which wouldn't do

anything yes because the Hulk is not

immune to fire the Hulk is immune to

fire oh my god he's on fire it kind of

hurts him but his healing factor so fast

he would have been healed by the time

even simply

the word healing fact has a healing

factor it's bad it's like credit roll

roll for critical resistance all right

fine

okay
