Oh, hello.

Technology isn't just
changing our lives.

It's changing our brains.

Not just how they think,

but how they look.

It's been shown that playing
certain video games for hours

can improve your memory
for details,

your ability
to navigate space

in video games,

and can make your brain--

well, certain parts
of it-- bigger.

But scientists want to know
if exploring digital worlds

can change our brains
in ways that improve our ability

to navigate the real world.

To find out,
we've built a giant maze

to test their theories
for the first time ever

outside the world of computers.

And my job?

I'm the lab rat.

[theme music playing]

[vacuum humming, stops]

Our brains have been
profoundly transformed

by our interactions
with technology.

A lot of the information
that I used to have to store

in my brain
is now stored in my phone.

My contacts, my schedule.

In many ways, I've delegated

what used to be done
by this organ

to this new external organ.

Doing that frees up
by brain's resources

for other things that matter

or that technology
can't quite do for us yet.

So while we all don't have
implants in our brains yet,

technology has already found
a way into our heads,

which is why you may find it
deeply disturbing

to see me do something
like this.

Sh--

[music playing]

[Michael] Studies show
 we can improve our brains

 by having enriching
 experiences,

 even by playing video games.

 To learn more about this,

I came to UC Irvine's Stark Lab
 to speak with experts

 in the field of learning
 and memory.

So Dane and Craig,
you guys work on

learning and memory.

- What about them?
- So the lab is trying
to figure out

how memory works,
how it works in the brain.

And one brain structure, in the
temporal lobe

that we know is important to
memory is

the hippocampus.

So what does
the hippocampus do?

We know it has a role in memory

and, really, a certain
kind of memory.

The hippocampus
is really involved

when you need to rapidly form
new arbitrary associations.

You know, remembering
what you did yesterday

definitely needs
the hippocampus.

 Maybe we'll go the store,
 we park our car in the lot,

 and we need to be able
 to remember

 not just, "I parked
 my car in the lot,"

 "I parked my car
 in this exact spot
 in the lot."

- [Michael] Right. 
- [Craig] And those details,

 that's what the hippocampus
 seems to be really be

 helping us out on.

And you keep looking down
at this piece of chewed

bubblegum on the book,
is that a hippocampus?

[Craig] Yes. This actually
is my hippocampus.

Is this the whole thing
or is it symmetric...

That's it--

Oh, there's one
on the other side.

That looks just like this?

Yeah, mirror image of it.

[Michael] In 2015,
 Dr. Stark and Dr. Clemenson,

 conducted a study to show

 how video games
 affect the brain.

 They gathered participants

 who normally didn't play
 video games

 and split them up
 into three groups.

A control group who didn't play

 any video games for two weeks,
 an active control group

 who played two-dimensional
 games for two weeks,

 and an experimental group

 who played 3D games
 for two weeks.

 Beforehand, they had all
 the participants

 perform two virtual tasks
 on computers

 to measure
 their spatial memory.

As soon as they came back,
we re-administered
those two tasks.

 And what we found was that the
 people who played the 3D game

 saw an improving
 in their test scores,

 whereas the control group

 and active control group
 did not.

 We didn't do brain scans,

 but we can speculate
 that there were changes

 to the experimental group's
 hippocampi.

So what are we going to be
doing to me here?

So we're gonna do everything
that we've done before

in our past studies,

except we're gonna add
two new things.

Uh, the first is we're gonna
add some brain scans,

so we're gonna see
if we see a change

in the structural side
of your hippocampus.

We've never actually looked
at somebody's brain scans

before and after
they played video games.

And the second thing
we're actually gonna do

is we're gonna put you through
a real-world space.

You're gonna be the rat
in a maze.

[Michael]
 This truly untested territory.

 The effect of video-gaming
 on spatial memory

 has never been studied
 in a physical environment

 on a scale this big
 and comprehensive.

 I will have to navigate my way

 through a 3,600-square-foot
 physical maze.

 Will playing video games
 improve my mental skills

 in the real world?

 If so, society
 may start looking

 at gaming in a whole new way.

 First, we had to get

 baseline measurements
 of my brain.

Welcome to the MRI Center.

We're gonna be taking a whole
series of scans of you,

as the before scan

to then see what's gonna be
happening to your brain

as a function of actually
doing the gaming.

Cool. What kind of things
are you looking for?

Changes in the size and shape
of your hippocampus

and also changes
in the connectivity
between brain regions.

[Michael] My brain was scanned
 using diffusion MRI,

 with a special emphasis

 on my all-important
 hippocampus.

[music playing]

[Craig] So this first test

is a standard memory test
that we do.

It's called an object
recognition memory test.

[Michael]
 This test began by showing me

 a series of random objects.

 I did my best to commit
 every one of them to memory.

Okay.

- Finished.
- All right.

What we're gonna do now though,
is we're gonna test

- your memory for those objects.
- Okay.

And this is actually
where it starts to tap

into the hippocampus
that we know is so important

for things
like spatial memory.

 [Michael] This time, I had to
 view another series of objects

 and identify
 any that were identical

 to the ones
 I'd seen previously.

 The catch, some of the items
 were very similar

 to the earlier ones,

 but not exactly the same.

 This tested my memory
 for details

 and very slight changes.

Okay.

[Michael] Next up, a virtual
 version of a water maze

 normally used by rodents
 and mice.

[Dane] The idea is that
you are trying to locate

a hidden platform
in a pool of water.

[Michael] Oh, man,

I'm so glad I'm not a lab rat.

This task really put my spatial
 memory to the test.

 I had to find the same
 invisible underwater platform

 over and over again,

 using only the shapes
 of the mountains as my guide,

 but at least I didn't have
 to get wet.

Hey.

That was more difficult
than I expected.

[Craig] These are the sorts of
tasks that we've been able to do

because we can put them
on a computer.

And we're gonna revisit them

after you've done
the video games.

But we also have a really
great opportunity here now

to be able to try to take it out
of just doing it on the computer

and actually get it
into the real world.

Have you guys done
this before?

No. We don't get to do
this kind of thing.

- Well, welcome
to the Mind Field. 
- Awesome.

[music playing]

[Michael]
So this is it? It's huge.

[Craig] This is what
we brought you here for,

to have a real-world test
of memory.

You're gonna be
a lab rat in a maze.

So this is a big first for us.

It's a big first really
for memory research.

[Michael]
So how do you think
that'll effect

what you guys
have already seen,

which is
that moving around
in a 3D environment

in a video game can
actually physically
affect your brain?

[Dane] We would expect that
if we can somehow, kind of,

train your hippocampus
to be better
at spatial memory

and spatial navigation,
we would see improvements

in some of these areas.

And it's not just
gonna be running a maze.

You've got objects
embedded inside here,

and we're gonna be testing
your ability to remember
where everything is.

Oh, and build a mental map
of whatever's inside there.

[Craig]
So you have five minutes.

Go on in, explore,
learn the maze,

and learn the objects.

Go.

[Michael] Because the walls
 were six feet tall,

 I was unable to get
 a bird's-eye view.

 My task was to create
 a spatial memory

 based entirely on the angles
 and turns of the white walls

 I could see at eye level,

 and a few tall trees
 and light poles

 outside the maze.

Okay. So I've oriented myself.

The entrance is that way.

There's an exit over there.

I'm considering this the right
side, that the left side.

I've got a vague idea
of where things are

that I feel like exist
along the outside edge,

but I don't know about
a lot of the stuff inside.

[Craig] And time.

All right. So
now you've had a chance
to explore the maze,

find out where
the objects are.

Now we're gonna test
your memory...

- Okay.
- ...and we'll be timing you

and seeing where you go.

- Okay.
- Okay. You ready?

- I'm ready.
- [Dane] So your first object

is the bicycle pump.

- Go.
- [Michael] Pump. Okay.

[Michael] Pump was just
always making right turns,

hugging the rightmost
part of-- pump.

Ha ha! Yes. Easy. Okay.

Now, I guess I do the opposite
to get out.

Left side-- yup,
I think I should make this turn.

There it is.

- You asked for a pump?
- All right.

Item two, the basketball.

[Michael] Later, Dr. Stark
 and Dr. Clemenson

 would evaluate my performance

 on how fast I was,
 the number of errors I made,

 and whether I took the most
 optimal route each time.

[Craig] And time.

Third item
is the cat. Go.

[Michael]
Here kitty, kitty, kitty.

Got it.

[Dane] The fourth item
is the pillow.

[Michael]
Retracing my steps.

- [Dane] The crayon. 
- [Michael] Easy.

- [Dane] The book. 
- [Michael] Okay.

[Dane] The boot.

Last item
is the water bottle.

- Go.
- [Michael] Water bottle.

I think--

by--

Yeah, it was back here.

Maybe on the other side
of this wall.

No? Oh, shoot.

Okay. Maybe it's down here.

Oh, wait.

That's-- no?

That's the central cube.

It was down some sort of...

a long corridor like this
in this area.

Oh, man.

[Michael] Until this point,
 things had gone pretty well,

 but now it felt like
 my hippocampus was failing me.

 With most of the items
 now gone,

 I couldn't use them
 for reference,

 and it was difficult
 to distinguish the differences

 between the various
 white corridors.

Oh, dang it.

Oh, what about through--

Got it.

- Bottle coming up.
- [Craig] All right.
There you go.

- [Michael] Got it. Nice.
- That one was a little
tougher, huh?

[Michael]
Yeah, it was tougher.

- So we found all eight objects.
- Yup.

[Dane] Now, we're gonna make it
a little bit more difficult.

So we're gonna move
onto the next phase

and that's gonna be
from the other side.

[Craig] Navigating
the maze in reverse

will be an even bigger test
of your spatial memory.

We're gonna give you
a list of four things to get,

in order.

[Dane] So the first sequence
is the book,

the bottle, the crayon,

and the boot.

- Go.
- [Michael] Book.

I think--

That's the ball.

Got it.

Oh, yeah, bottle
was that hard one,

but now I remember
which alley to go down.

Perfect.

Crayon.

Boot. Don't want that.

Here it is.

Okay. Now, I need the boot.

Oh, I just saw the boot,

but how did I--

Got it.
I'm done. I'm coming back.

- Got them.
- [Craig] All right.

So then the next four.

[Dane] The pump, the pillow,

the basketball, and the cat.

- [Craig] All right. Excellent.
- [Dane] All right. Nice job.

[Michael] Okay.
So that was really fun,

but I can't be
the only subject.

This experiment
could use a control.

How else will we know that me,
enriching my life

with daily
video game playing,

really causes a change
in my spatial memory, right?

Well, luckily for that,

we've got a nice
matched control.

Guys similar to me.

Okay, one of them
has too much hair,

but you guys look good.

- You ready?
- [all] Ready.

[Michael] In every experiment,

 it's important to have
 a control group.

 My look-alikes had to go
 through the exact same tests

 as I did in the maze

 to establish
 their individual baselines.

 The difference would be
 that they would play

 absolutely no video games
 for the next 10 days.

 Then any change
 in my performance

 would be compared against
 any changes in theirs.

[music playing]

 Next, I began
 my gaming regimen,

 starting
 from an ideal baseline,

 since I haven't played
 video games

 since I was a kid.

 Would ten days of gaming
 really make a difference?

[music playing]

Technology isn't just affecting
the way we remember things.

- [whirring]
- It's also playing
with the empathy

and social circuits
of our brains.

In fact, in many cases,

we are more comfortable
relating to machines

than we are to people.

Just think about how much
we care about our phones.

Roboticist
and MIT Media Lab alum,

Alex Reben,
invented the BlabDroid,

 a miniature robot equipped
 with a camera

 and an innocent little voice

 that asks
 very personal questions

 of unsuspecting pedestrians.

 [BlabDroid] If you could
 take back one mistake,

 what would it be?

Oh, gosh.
I only get to take back one?

[Michael]
 The majority of people

 instantly shared
 intimate details.

[BlabDroid] Tell me something
 that you've never told

 a stranger before.

I'm scared
I won't be able to love

and to let myself go
in a love relationship.

[Michael] In many ways,

 we are more comfortable
 talking to a machine

 than to a human.

But what about talking
through a machine?

I mean, it's often easier to say

difficult things
to a person via text

instead of in real life,
isn't it?

Well, what if the person
on the other end

wasn't a friend
or a significant other,

but was a therapist?

 A mental healthcare startup
 called Talkspace

 allows adult users
 who pay a weekly fee

 to text therapists for advice.

[woman] At Talkspace,
 we believe that therapy

 should be anonymous,
 stigma-free,

 simple, affordable,
 and comfortable.

Texting can give users
the distance they need

to be open and honest.

And messages can be sent
when the user wants,

 not during an appointment

 or business hours only.

[woman] Talkspace,

 therapy for how we live today.

[Michael] How am I?

Better now that my phone
is working.

Sometimes, however,
we aren't looking for
technology to comfort us.

we're finding ourselves
wanting to comfort technology.

This is a ROBOTIS OP2.

Cute little fellow, isn't he?

So how did that make you feel?

Bad?

Well, why?

Robots are just machines,

metal and wires
and computer chips.

But we spend a lot of time
with technology.

We depend on technology,

and we care about it.

But the degree to which
we empathize with it

depends on context.

[music playing]

[Michael]
 Recently, my Vsauce office

 was invaded by bugs--

 robot hexbugs, that is.

 These bugs are made
 of plastic, metal,

 and electronic circuitry.

 They aren't alive.

 But could certain conditions

 cause them to inspire
 empathy in humans?

 A 2015 MIT study

 found that giving a robot
 movement, a name,

 and a personal backstory

 tends to increase
 its anthropomorphic effect,

 which can lead to
 an emotional connection

 with humans.

 We decided to see this in
 action.

- Thank you for your help today.
- Of course. Pleasure.

[Michael]
 In our demonstration,

 our subjects think
 they're focus testing

a new user-friendly technology.

 In this case,
they're given a lifeless hexbug

 and asked to describe it.

This thing kind of
looks like a bug,

only I don't know
what it does.

It has a switch on the bottom.

It's light.

It's sort of a rectangle,

but the ends
are like hexagons.

[Michael] Then it was time
 to test their empathy.

Now, Karina,
what I would
like you to do now

is place the item
in the middle
of that block.

There's a magnet
that will hold it.

And I would like for you
to take this mallet

and please smash it.

Yeah. Really? Okay.
This is cool.

[Michael] Our participants
 demonstrated no resistance

 to smashing
 this lifeless object.

 Many of them
 even seemed to enjoy it.

Do you feel bad
for breaking it?

Not really.
I felt indifferent to it.

Not really 'cause
it wasn't real. [laughing]

Not really.

[Michael] While these subjects
 exhibited no empathy

 to the inanimate bugs,

look what happened when we gave
 the exact same bugs

 names and movement.

This is Margaret. Okay.

I'm gonna place Margaret
down here.

I just want you
to take a moment

to watch Margaret,
all right?

And you could feel free
to pick her up.

She's really well-behaved.

- She's honestly one
of our favorites.
- [woman, laughing] Okay.

So how would you describe
Margaret's personality?

A little erratic right now,

but I think if I pick her up,
she calms down.

[Michael] Notice
 how the subject has already

 anthropomorphized the object,
 referring to it as "she."

Maybe she feeds off
my energy.

Could be.

Go towards the light.

Go towards the middle.

[Michael] Do you think
Margaret likes you?

Yeah, maybe that's why
she's doing this,

and maybe when I go
like that,

she doesn't act
all erratic.

That's Aaron.

Hi, Aaron.

He can be a bit
of a pistol.

- No way.
- Yes.

It really depends on
who's holding him.

[laughing]

Oh, yeah.
He's got a lot of energy.

Aaron, hi.

[Michael] Now that you've
interacted with Eli a bit more,

how would you describe
his personality?

Probably he's just nervous.
He's scared.

- He doesn't know
what's going on.
- Hey, Joe.

[Michael] Will these subjects
 be just as willing

 to smash their bugs?

Amy, I'm gonna place
Margaret right here,

and then I
would like for you
to take this mallet,

and I'd like you
to smash it.

No.

I don't wanna hurt it.

Just take this mallet
and smash Aaron.

[music playing]

[Michael]
I'm gonna ask you
to take this mallet,

and I'd like for you
to smash it.

Smash it?

Hit it?

And, Chris...

You want me to kill Joe?

Please smash Joe.

Ugh.

Joe, I'm sorry.

Oh, Joe. Joe.

[music playing]

Now, how did it feel
to smash Aaron?

It didn't feel good,
you know,

after spending time with him

and getting to know him.

Even though
it's lifeless

and doesn't have a mind
of its own,

instantly,
I grew attached to it,

because when I put it
in my hand,

I felt its energy.

I'm sorry, Joe.

- Do you feel bad?
- I do.

I do feel bad about Joe.

He was pretty cool.

Oh, he's back.

He's back?

Pump, pump.

Would you smash him again
to make sure

he doesn't come back?

- No.
- Why not?

I mean, he survived it.
He survived it once.

I'm not gonna do it again.

[Michael] Clearly,
it doesn't take much for humans

 to become emotionally
 attached to technology.

 But after my ten days
 of video-gaming--

Nice.

 I was about to find out
 if technology had

 affected my spatial memory

 and my physical brain.

[music playing]

 [Michael] All right.
 It's been ten days.

Exactly, so we're gonna look
at the difference between

your test ten days ago
and your test now

to see
do we see any change.

[Michael]
 First, I had to retake

 the object recognition
 memory test

and the Morris water maze task,

 both of which had been revised
 with different content

 than they had the last time.

I think I did better.

Dane and I will
analyze all this data
and see how you did.

But now we got to go back
to the full-size maze.

[music playing]

[Craig]
So we've got a new maze.

 Tore down the old one,
 built a new one

 to try to be isomorphic.

 So it has sort of the same
 level of difficulty.

 The same number
 of choice points,

 the same number of turns,

 the same total distance
 to each of one the objects

 to try to have a similar maze,
 but that's new.

Three, two, one, go.

[Michael] Right around here,

we got a bonsai.

 As before,
 I was given five minutes

 to familiarize myself
 with the maze

 and where all
 of the objects were.

Now, this is where I was
before I hugged that wall,

so if I hug
the second right wall

and stay all the way right,
a vase.

 Was my hippocampus
 working better?

 At this point,
 it was hard to tell.

Thirty seconds.

I'm not even sure
I've discovered

all the objects hidden here.

And time.

[Michael]
 Then my test began.

First object
is a rubber duck.

- Go.
- Rubber duck was way over here.

Yeah!
How do you like that?

I got a duck.

Second item
is the hat. Go.

[Michael] With this maze,
 I found myself instinctively

 using a different approach.

Top hat.

 Instead of thinking of the
 overall geography of the maze

 like I did last time,

 this time I was remembering
 specific details.

Second right,
hug the turn, got it.

 Literally recalling
 certain corners,

 turns, and straightaways.

Bonsai.

Now blue vase.

Oh, wow.
It's actually a cool vase.

 But would this improve
 my overall performance?

I got you a backpack.

- All right.
- Excellent.

So we've gotten
all the objects.

But, of course, we have
another memory test

that we're gonna do here.

We're gonna go around
to the other side of the maze

and test your memory
from there.

- [Michael] All right. 
- [Dane] So your first sequence

is the blue seahorse
the flashlight,

the rubber duck,
and the bonsai tree.

Go.

[Michael]
 With the multiple item tasks,

 even though I was working
 from the opposite entrance,

 I continued to recall
 various details of the maze,

 which seemed to serve me well.

From there,
it's just a little spiral.

Nice.

[bell dings]

[Dane] All right. Your next
sequence is the blue vase,

the hat, the backpack,

and the baseball glove. 
- [Craig] Hit it.

- And time.
- Awesome.

So how was it?

That was not as hard
as I expected.

- It was about details.
- [Craig] Right.

I was literally
thinking, "Oh, okay.

There's that turn,

and I could do one
or two things.

The glove's
the first one.

The bonsai's the one
even before."

I didn't even
plan that at all.
It just kind of happened.

 [Michael] My look-alikes were
 also tested in the new maze.

Have you been playing
video games?

[all] No, sir.

[Michael] Again,
 their non-gaming condition

 would be the control,

 with my amount of improvement,

 if any,
 measured against theirs.

[Craig] All right.
We're here for scan number two.

[Michael] Finally,
my brain was scanned once again

 to determine whether
 any physical changes
 had occurred.

 Dr. Stark and Dr. Clemenson
 would analyze the MRI

 along with all the other data
 and report their findings.

[music playing]

[Michael] I feel like
my hippocampus

is a little bit bigger.

Yep. Actually, no,
I don't know.

I'm anxious to see
what your results are.

I guess let's start
off first

with the object
recognition task.

And it's important to note
that in our control test
without video-gaming,

 people did not improve
 in this task, but...

your memory got better.

You went up by ten points.

Ten points is actually
20 years' worth

of what happens
to us as we age.

Oh, wow.

That's about what you might see

in someone
who's getting really old,

- but they might go down
by ten points.
- Exactly.

So the second one we did
was the virtual version

of the water maze task,
and you actually performed

30% better the second time
you did it.

Hey, not bad.

I could tell that I was
using better strategies.

Yeah.

- We also had the real maze.
- [Michael] Yeah.

[Craig] As you know,
 we made two mazes.

 Despite our efforts
 to try to equate them,

the second maze was
a little bit more difficult

than the first maze.

If we took a look
at things

like how quickly you
got the objects,

how many errors you made,
and we looked

at the control subjects'
performance in
pre- versus post-.

So on all of them,

 they actually got a little
 bit slower in maze two,

and all but one of them
made more errors.

We took a look
at your performance.

 You didn't get slower
 from maze one to two.

 You actually got faster.

- [Michael] Really? 
- [Craig] And you made the same

exact number of errors.

So they don't improve,
and you did.

 And even though
 this experiment

 had a small number
 of subjects,

 the results are consistent
 with our virtual maze study

 with 70 test subjects.

- [Craig] All right.
- Thank you, video games.

What about
inside my brain?

 [Craig] Inside your brain,
 it's a little tougher
 to really tell.

 We would expect
 that any effect of this

 is going to be small.

 I mean, we couldn't take
 your hippocampus

and make it twice as big

because then it would
have to be pushing
something else out.

So it's just not going
to be a large change.

So where we did find
a difference

is actually in the shape
of the hippocampus.

What we saw is
there were some regions

in the hippocampus
on both sides

 that appear
 to have changed shape

 from day one before gaming

 to day ten after gaming.

What's really surprising to me
is that as an adult,

my brain is still changing.

That makes me wanna take
better care of my brain.

Yes.

Exercise it more,
'cause it is a thing
that can change.

I'm not just stuck
with what I have now, today.

I mean, in all of this,
I think that the big takeaway

is that doing things,

giving your brain
something to learn,

something to do,
something to figure out,

this is what we think
is actually

keeping your brain sharp.

One way to do that is to keep
watching Mind Field.

[Craig] Exactly.

[music playing]

 [Michael] As our relationship
 with technology becomes
 ever stronger,

people are bound to worry about
what it will do to our brains.

Will offloading memory
and computing

to our machines make us dumber?

Will our empathy for machines
have negative consequences

for how we interact
with each other?

Well, let's look back
to another time

a new kind of technology
threatened

to fundamentally
change our brains.

Two and a half thousand
years ago,

the Greek philosopher, Socrates,

worried that
the wide use of writing

would have a negative impact
on people's minds.

He said that writing would,
to quote his student, Plato,

"Create forgetfulness,

because people will
not use their memories.

They will trust the external
written characters

and not remember themselves."

Socrates was right.

Written language did
fundamentally change our brains.

But it's also one of
the cornerstones of everything

modern civilization
has accomplished.

One of the defining
characteristics of being human

is that this is not
the boundary of my body,

and this is not the boundary
of my mind.

And, as always,
thanks for watching.
