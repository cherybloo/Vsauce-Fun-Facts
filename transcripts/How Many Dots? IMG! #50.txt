Wait, hold on a second.
I have a tail?

Whoa!
And how many red dots

can you count?
Look close. It's episode 50

of IMG!
Static electricity and packaging peanuts are always fun

together,

so is the creation of atom,
even though cats and dogs can do it too.

Oh, and this giraffe is having a fun
time, because he's being

kissed by a giraffe.
Peek-a-boo.

Peek-a-boo.
The only thing more delicious than a hamburger

eye makeup are Vsauce nails.
And,

if you walk around with your lips
puckered, from certain perspectives this

will happen. And is this a guy with no neck
wearing a purple shirt or is it...

wait, what? Now, this picture exhibits a
similar illusion. Get it?

It's just like this girl with a hairy
arm that I showed in a previous IMG!

Now, speaking of hair, here are some
wonderfully rigid structures

drawn

with hair-thin thread.
Even Chewbacca

is hair. And here's a pretty scene that
from far away or with your eyes squinted

looks like a skull.
Aww, a cute duck.

Gosh, dang it.
Short of the Week illustrated something

interesting.
The top 10 grossing films over periods of

10 years.
Blue titles are original ideas,

gray represents adaptations and pink represents

sequels.
Now, watch what happened as time went on.

In 2011, there wasn't a single

original movie idea in the top 10.
Tetris tights.

Now, let's watch a bunch of dogs

wearing shoes.

Here's a transformer who becomes a Game Boy.

And if your chin folds,
combined with your forehead creases

you wind up like this.
Draw bridge? Okay, if you say so.

And if you want to see a visualization
of the last 100 years

of shark attacks,
the National Post has this mammoth,

showing where in the world and where on the
body people became victims.

On Facebook, Kess warned us about the very serious

issue of drowning. LOL. And Leonardo showed us crayons carved into Star Wars shapes.

But you won't get lost with this giant
comprehensive math

of the entire Star Wars galaxy.
If you'd rather map something

fewer light years across,
check out this site, where you can see a map of the

wind, its patterns, as it invisibly tangles itself

across the USA.
Geographies of the World's Knowledge is a free booklet

available as a PDF or an iPad book and it shows

the distribution of knowledge in the
Internet age. The size of each country

is relative to number of people in it

who have access to Internet.
Its redness

is equal to the percentage.
And this map

shows the distribution of heavy metal
bands from around the world.

Now look at this from a distance and you will see

yourself. With most Vsauce videos end it's
like the end of a schools zone,

but when IMG number 50 is over,
it's the end of a

cool zone.
So, kitty, turn off the lights, because

as always,

thanks for watching.
