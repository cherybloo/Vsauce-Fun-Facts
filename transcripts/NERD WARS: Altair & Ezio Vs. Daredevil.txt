it was Jeff Ryman this is Anna

mcLaughlin we're coming at you with

another nerd wars this one I'll tie here

versus daredevil oh my god I am going to

win so easy as always I would be taking

the superhero daredevil and I'm gonna

get gas and I'm gonna be taking I'll tie

here from Assassin's Creed because well

I like in my ass kicked because he's emo

alright daredevil has spandex but all

Tiger has Renaissance clothing and

Renaissance clothing is by far less gay

than spandex

clearly Jeff has never been to a

Renaissance Festival yes I have and let

me tell you those people are cool I

don't know if you know my friend Marc

actually goes all the time he'd bring

this family it's this bro you know I've

really kind of would want to go to a

Renaissance so lame so lame I caught him

in a lie really every the point I'll tie

here no that's at a point at a point

that's a point for health I own number

one all right say what you will about

Renaissance attire uh-huh Daredevils

outfit much cooler spandex spandex is

much cooler which you can only get away

with your fly man it's like have you

seen Stevie Wonder's outfits Stevie

Wonder you have a boy like yes by

someone who's playing a practical joke

as does daredevil look seriously this

looks good sir put it on daredevil uses

his sonar in order to pick the perfect

costume that's why I stopped wearing the

the yellow and black yellow and black

makes more noise than red well if

they're they were pretty loud colors

can't believe that argument let's go

back to facts all right all tire has the

knowledge of every previous assassin and

the skills of every assassin before and

the all Thai airline has now figured out

how to go through time they're gonna go

back in time to a time that their asses

will be kicked by daredevil up back in

time when daredevil had sight here here

didn't have sonar where he was like 12

that's fine let's shank him right there

okay well I think generations of

assassins would know to kill him before

he got powerful in

that case why is assassin screen even a

game why can't I just go back in time to

when all these people are babies and

killed him attempt be boring as a game

exactly and that's a boring fight so

we're gonna talk about daredevil the guy

from Assassin's Creed in you know

present-day and I'm running this as many

times as I've said I'll tie here he

still doesn't know his name I'll tie

here so yeah I said it

here's the thing all right all Tigers

only thing is sneaking up on people like

a douche all right daredevil has Sonic

yes sonic hearing he he sees radar hey

you wanna sit you wonder how that fight

would go down and you'd be daredevil

alright hey I see you right there no no

it's not just one that is not a wig I'll

tell you're just well I'm not me I don't

know if you know I'll tear was bald no

he's not but here's in my number one

couldn't sneak up on daredevil number

two daredevil number two daredevil is an

accomplished martial artist and he's our

Assassin's you don't do you think

assassins are just sitting there yoga

but number three downward dog number

three though he is at the epitome of

human physical condition like him him

and Captain America are like almost par

on fighting ability

I'm glad you named the two gayest DC

characters right there they're not DC

characters go play your Nintendo play

some Sonic the Hedgehog on Nintendo i

have i love make you more Madden so

anyway we're gonna give this one to I'll

tell you no we're not it has no it's a

total one-sided fight dare don't you're

right I'll tell you would win daredevil

would you know what Ben Affleck could

beat up all tie year Ben Affleck is

there no Ben Affleck

well sittin on sittin on the couch

voyeur you don't know Damon is met

an assassin and he's just been getting

close to Ben Affleck the whole time so

you you know what that would be awesome

if Matt Damon's listening to this please

kill Ben Affleck so if you have

suggestions put them in the comments

we'd love to do them

we'll keep arguing them as long as you

keep putting them up and if you start

hating them well we'll blame it on Adam

thanks guys
