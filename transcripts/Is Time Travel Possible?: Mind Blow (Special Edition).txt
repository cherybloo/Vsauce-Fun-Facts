John Titor claims to be a time traveler

from the Year 2036 and his time machine

kind of looks like a certain DeLorean

whose parts you can actually buy Vsauce

Kevin here this is Milo

time travel edition this is a real time

machine sort of dr. Ronald Mallett time

machine is a spiral of incredibly

powerful lasers and he wishes to send a

particle down and on a spacetime

altering ride into the past

unfortunately it hasn't worked out yet

and no visitors from the future have

arrived Isaac Newton thought time was

like an arrow flying in a straight line

Albert Einstein whoever thought of it

like a river flowing around stars

speeding up and slowing down in fact he

theorized the rate at which time passes

depends on how fast you're going

so someone orbiting the Earth and the

speed of light would actually alter

time-space and when they return to Earth

they will be in the future his theory

was right satellites orbiting the Earth

actually have to alter their clocks to

synchronize with earth time because of

this scientific fact check out this

clock example hold still and the clock

ticks at a normal pace move the clock

and a ticks take longer therefore if you

were in a ship aboard the green orb your

space time would be different from the

time of the guy holding the clock

unfortunately we can't go nearly fast

enough in spaceships to make a

noticeable time change but we could hop

a ride on the blackhole Express spitting

us at incredible speeds like this coffee

spins this beam we'd surely end up in a

different time but no one seems to have

a black hole handy

so instead Stephen Hawking has worms

wormholes to be exact

these are tunnels connecting massive

distances by bending space-time like two

holes on a piece of paper being folded

together wormholes exist in a teeny tiny

play is called quantum foam and we have

no idea how to enlarge them enough for a

human to pass through let alone a TARDIS

the grandfather paradox arises when you

travel into the past and kill your

grandfather thereby never being born and

never being able to travel into the past

to kill your grandmother

David Deutsch believes parallel

universes exist so you could go back in

time for

alternate world without affecting the

one you came from in which case you can

go back and shoot a dinosaur in the face

and your grandpa will be fine

finally to check out an iconic

time-traveling show watch the new season

premiere of Doctor Who Saturday April

23rd at 9:00 8:00 central on BBC America

I'm gonna leave you with a riddle

I'm the beginning of the end and the end

of time and space

I'm essential to creation and I surround

every place what am i leave your answer

in the comments below and we're going to

do the genius of the week a little

differently this time what would you do

if you had a time machine send us a

video response with the tag if I had a

time machine and the person with the

best answer will be our genius of the

week and you can check out everyone's

stories at Time Machine tales comm so

good luck and as always thanks for

watching
