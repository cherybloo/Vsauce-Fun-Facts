it's fun to dress up your elf princess

but if you're looking for an online game

that'll put some hair on your chest

let's take a look at 10 incredibly

badass online games

first mechanical commando a top-down

shooter that asks why would you ever let

go of the trigger

if you're more of a nature lover go

fishing but not like a [ __ ] in this

game you reel in fish flip them in the

air and shoot them with a shotgun i

think this is how red lobster does it

if you're more of a military strategist

here's a tower defense game where you

pick and place your defense it's not the

best one i've ever played but the

enemies are zombies

if you'd rather play as a zombie zombie

bites is a cute little game where you

eat people to stay alive but watch out

for zombie hunters and be careful

because everyone you eat becomes a

zombie you have to compete with

sticking to the zombie theme zombie golf

riot is nice and simple you aim with

your mouse and then swing with your

mouse and the golf ball is a zombie's

head

to cuten things up let's talk about

penguins they're nice and mild but give

them oozies and baseball bats and you've

got penguins

with a z

this curious welt lane might seem cuddly

but in order to win you have to eat the

parasites your mother vomits down on you

and shoot the evil guys by barfing up

your own blood

if you want something more calculated

try tactical assassin substratum you'll

be given specific instructions and

you'll need a steady hand and mine beans

are the magical fruit but they can also

be gangsta bean

and finally try kill cartoon revenge

you've gotta finish laps but also run

over shoot and launch missiles plus as

you earn money you can upgrade your car

and customize its look you can play all

these games right now by following links

in this video's description and let me

know in the comments below what is the

most badass thing you've ever done i

can't wait to hear your answers i've got

a special episode of img coming up this

weekend but for now use this grid to

watch other v-lists and as always thanks

for watching
