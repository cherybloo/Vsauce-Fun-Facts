nerd wars Vin Diesel vs. Marvel

characters take two so this week we're

doing a Vin Diesel from Riddick

yes or Riddick or as Vin Diesel or

ridiculous that movie versus versus The

Punisher The Punisher be one of the

baddest characters blackest wearing

character with the skull on his chest

and all the Marvel Universe

yeah I'd say I'd say you're right yeah

you got that one I got that one point

Riddick

but no how is that all right I know jive

I name a fact I get a point which as

people watch you know I don't do that

very often Jeff why don't you go ahead

kick off the argument okay I am gonna

give Riddick the battle if only for his

extra human vision he polished his

eyeballs polished his eyes I haven't

seen the Punisher do anything remotely

that badass Riddick he lives in this

world where it's like you know he's in

outer space they have space cards

something night vision

that's his friggin power night vision I

got news punisher has night vision guy

you've been trapped in interstellar

minds here's how a battle between

Punisher and and freakin Riddick would

work in a mine I win I win

no Betty say that isn't punishes like

weird my glasses Adam can't even see

right now put him on go ahead you know

you're a friggin idiot Jeff you're

friggin idiot all right

like seriously critics only thing is

being able to see that was that's it's

pretty much like a race of warrior you

know here's came from a warrior race

yeah and he's the last surviving guy and

he was an elite warrior in the warrior

race let me let me ask you something

mm-hmm have you ever read Punisher vs.

the Marvel Universe have you ever read

freakin Riddick fanfic Punisher kills

the Marvel Universe Punisher kills

everyone in the Marvel Universe Captain

America including Captain America with a

gun with a gun what point xxx xxx just

won that battle

xxx isn't the Punisher there's a

difference there's no there's a

difference let's get caring there's a

difference keep arguing this [ __ ]

alright all I go to ultimate trump card

ballot you make you have ultimate trump

card one more point no forget about one

more

one more point yeah one more point is I

just want to mention some of the other

crappy movies Vin Diesel's been in the

pacifier all right you're telling me the

guy from the pacifier can beat the

Punisher absolutely wrong Iron Giant -

Iron Giant

another turd what yes you're dead

you heard it dead to me you heard it

here it's the ultimate point yeah let's

hear it

freakin ridic spent an entire movie with

Claudia Black Point Riddick no that's

not the back boy hottest women and all

sci-fi in my name in my book fire escape

on the best science that has to do joint

Riddick that has nothing to do with a

fight between these two people that has

nothing to do with the fight but okay

these do people that mine he wins the

mine scenario hands-down he wins the

club that he wins the woman's scenario

hands down what what is uh what does he

got going for him what Riddick nothing

Punisher the only way that Riddick would

beat the Punisher is if affirmative

action got involved because since he's

mentally [ __ ] they probably just

give it to him Riddick basically took

out an entire empire it took out an

entire empire I've already mentioned

Punisher took out every superhero that

exists in the entire Marvel Universe

yeah and Riddick took out an entire

empire yeah an entire empire of [ __ ]

yeah you heard me did you see those guys

yeah the kill Maury or whatever the

Frick don't [ __ ] warp through space

kind of yeah they can barely describe it

an intergalactic species of emo kids

okay that's what that's what Riddick can

do that's yeah way to go way to go next

time there's a rave I need to break up

I'll call a Vin Diesel but if I need a

badass guy to get killed I'm called when

the Punisher and next time I have a

party I'm calling Vin Diesel - I'm not

inviting the people you sure cuz he

can't get any ladies he'd be fun at a

party he would be if this was an

argument who would be a better party

guest I'd say Vin Diesel Vin Diesel in a

heartbeat

keep posting your suggestions I'll keep

arguing and making Adam upset

you
