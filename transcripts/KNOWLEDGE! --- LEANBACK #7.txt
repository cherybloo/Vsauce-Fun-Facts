Hello, Vsauce. Michael here,
and today I have a brand new episode

of Vsauce Leanback, a playlist that I host
made out of awesome videos from

all over YouTube.
The theme for this one is stuff

I didn't know last week, but now I do.
It's fun and you can begin at anytime by

clicking the link at the top

of this video's description. If you're on a
mobile device, it probably won't work,

so wait until you're at a computer and
then you can lean back.

In the meantime I'm gonna give you one
cool fact and four things you can do

online now guys.

Alright, first the fact.
America and Europe are on

different tectonic plates and these plates
are slowly moving apart from each other,

which means that every year America and Europe

are 1 inch further apart.
You know what else grows

at one inch a year?
Fingernails.

What's cool about that is that,
for instance if you live in America,

every time you look at your fingernails
you can think "hmmm, since the last time I

clipped these,

Europe is that much farther away."
Pretty neat.

If you enjoy deep emotional flash games,
"veronica1095" sent me a list

of some really cool ones.
But if you prefer making your own music,

check out Qwerty Beats.
All you need to be a DJ is your mouse

and your keyboard.

If you want your mind blown by
perspective, play Adult Swim's Cardboard

Box

Assembler. This game is laid out on a
three-dimensional cube

and as you run around you can change what's up

and what's down. And finally, if you're one
of those people who hate Vsauce

Leanbacks because they're so long,

go check out 5secondfilms.
It's a YouTube channel

with 775 hilarious videos,

so short they're only five seconds long. And what the

H, here's a bonus.
This guy is counting to 1 billion

on YouTube.
One number at a time, one video

for each number. He's only up to about
200 right now, but let me give you a taste.

Here's a good one. 23.
Twenty-three.

Nice. So, what are you waiting for?

of Vsauce

Leanback.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
