hey Vsauce how are you doing it's

Michael here at the 2010 New York

ComiCon and I'm joined by Ramona myself

and Rusty are going to be counting down

the top superheroes to have a child with

so I'm going to let you be my first

victim what superhero would you want to

have a child with and why Captain

America okay good he's a shield he can

protect you but you know he knows he

knows how to get a little violent oh wow

I didn't know that if you could have a

have a child with any superhero who

would it be Wonder Woman Lady Deadpool

someone that doesn't fly why I don't

want to like you know it's like up there

what am I going to do definitely not the

Flash not the FL not the Flash not the

Invisible

Man nothing is going to make it

difficult maybe the blob The Blob all

right if you could have a child with any

superhero what superhero would it be

ooh that's pretty

tough Superman cuz he'd be a super

baby

[Music]

I think that's a very easy question

because all superheroes generally have

anger management issues or alcoholism or

something but Superman doesn't and who's

going to be going to Kryptonite anytime

soon so I think that he's the best shot

for a good Offspring in vitro in

vitro surrogate baby

surrogate Deadpool Deadpool you're

you're wearing Green Lantern and still

Deadpool I'm a Marvel fan I'm also a

Marvel fan all right you're still a

Marvel fan now would the baby be

disfigured like Wade probably but that'd

be because I can dress him up in like a

little Deadpool outfit and he'd be so

cute probably

Batman Gambit he's so much sexier than

Batman I'm sorry i' probably have to go

with rogue rogue all right all right

Rogue you probably die having that baby

yeah but it'd be worth it man White

Queen White Queen Wolverine Wolverine

the baroness the

baroness this baroness wow wow that is

four did you know that I didn't wow this

is a revelation right now where right

now they just Express their love for

each other or he expressed love for her

and it's gone unreciprocated which is

awkward for the rest of the day so there

you go those are the answers we got at

Comic-Con but let me know who you would

choose in the comments below remember it

would be a kid that was half you and

half whichever superhero you pick okay

so put it in the comments and I'm going

to throw it over to Jeff to curate all

of the other stuff that Vsauce Barely

Political Rusty Andre fetchko blah blah
