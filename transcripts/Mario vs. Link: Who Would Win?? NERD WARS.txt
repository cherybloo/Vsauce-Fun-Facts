I beat enough hammer brothers in Mario

games to know you can just jump over

that boomer I can't Ange I'm for shame

right on Lynx head they can't aim for

 and then aim for nothing you can

throw the boomerang and then you could

just knife the guy when you came too

close no yes no what I mean what else

you got oh okay well doesn't have the

power the Triforce the link doesn't have

any power whatsoever League magical

power Blin Triforce is sniveling a

little Oh hold on here you're

talking that the guy who cleans drains

for a living is going to defeat a hero

that's his whole purpose is to be hero

no the thing is Mario you think that

shield would stop him Mario would just

go down a tunnel to go down a pipe flute

pop right up behind them fireball

freak but no crime tunnel there's

tunnels too there's tunnels in Mario I

decide to use a pipe at the bottom of

pipes hmm I could also go into a snake

barrel if it's my brother - let's talk

about pack up Posse link has no backup

Posse we're not talking about

where's his Yoshi fairies fairies all

right

link hangs out with a bunch of fairies

that's all he's got Mario has got his

brother

all right Luigi he's got Yoshi he's got

Princess Toadstool which just proves how

lame Mario is he needs this backup Posse

where's up link can just go strength in

numbers

Lincoln be on his own and just save the

world third reason Mario I'd like to see

Mario pull the sword he could pull a

sword he can't pull the sword up he

could pull his own camp if he can pull

the daikon raddish not handled around

her sword if he can pull the daikon

radishes out of the ground in Mario

Brothers 2 he can pull a sword link

pulls up bushes Shh anybody could do

that pushes out any ground

Mario lifts all sorts of people right

above his head just throws and links a

stone-cold killer link is not a stone

cold have you seen how he like just

burns bushes down breaks people taught a

to the carapace is rude he's rude he's

an independent thinker all right

independent thinker mario has the

ability to grow facial hair while link

is prepubescent I can drone up yeah link

links grow narrow game link links grown

up in several games he grows up into a

taller little boy he never looks like a

man you know why cuz he doesn't a damn

man call me web link call me out mute

you doesn't need to be a man to defeat

Mario yet you do need to be Amanda

Bartoli's like a 7 year old

he's a 7 year old plumber Mario is

probably in like his mid-30s no he's way

older than that

yeah if you look the way think he's

wearing a head all the time look I know

at Mario my guy who knows he's not bald

balding that's no that's not why where's

the hell don't you take off with a hat

to Luigi he he wears the Hat because

underneath that he has all of his hair

he has a flowing mane he's like Fabio

he's like an Italian Fabio cuz I don't

think it's Fabio's Italian so it's a lot

more is just two company I'm gonna I'm

gonna give this one to link you're gonna

give it to Lake just because that's what

you want to say you're talking because
