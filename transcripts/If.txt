Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Earlier this month

I travelled to Kourou in French Guiana 
with euronews

to watch the launch of Vega Rocket,

if it happened

while I was there. Waiting at the
observation point with only minutes to go,

the launch was postponed because of weather.

Even though the rocket scientists were

using Comic Sans, the rocket it didn't take off

until the day after I had to be back in London.

But it made me think.
We can send satellites into orbit

and people to the moon and predicts solar eclipses

thousands of years into the future but yet

we cannot reliably predict which way the
wind will be blowing

in the next our or so. How can such
monumental cosmic movements

light minutes or light years away from
us be understood,

whereas the weather, which happens in the
very same layer of the atmosphere we

live in every day,

remains such a mystery?
Well,

it has to do with the limits of what we know

and what we can know.
Planetary positions

and terrestrial weather in the future
are determined by their

initial conditions.

But over a short time scale predicting
the future position of a planet

involves fewer variables than the weather.

In order to accurately predict the
weather, you need to know the complete

and exact conditions

of every molecule of air on Earth.
How those molecules will interact with each

other

and the earth and how they will feedback
and influence themselves by changing

other molecules. This makes it incredibly
difficult to predict the weather more

than a week

in advance.
And this problem isn't going to go away.

It is fundamental to our relationship with the universe.

Given enough time small, unnoticeable,

unmeasurable, unknowable factors get magnified

again and again slowly

until eventually their impact is vastly significant

and our predictions today are hopeless.

Neil deGrasse Tyson mentions this in his
brilliant "Death by Black Hole,"

where he points out that the recoil
from the launch of a single

space probe can influence our future in
such a way

that in about 200 million years

the position of Earth and its orbit around
the Sun will be shifted

by nearly sixty degrees.

Edward Lorenz gave this phenomenon
its popular name.

"Predictability; Does the Flap of a Butterfly's wings

in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?"

The butterfly effect.
A small change,

like a butterfly deciding to flap its wings,

can lead to a whole chain of events
were bigger

and bigger processes change just enough
to leave the even more significant

changes until finally an entire storm

occurs somewhere different or not

at all.
The discipline that such thinking

kick-started is known as chaos theory.

When the present determines the future,
but the approximate

present does not approximately determine the future.

To us the universe is full

of "if". But all things considered, we
are pretty good at predicting the future

and preparing for it, but some things

are or were prepared for a future
that hasn't occurred yet

or never did.
And knowing more about those things

sheds amazing perspective on the limits of our knowledge.

Speaking of limits, let's begin with your life,

carpe diem.
An online tool that when given your birth date

uses the latest life expectancy data to
give you back

a grid of squares.
One square represents

one week - seven days. The lighter ones are
the weeks that you have already

been alive, the darker ones are what you have left.

Check "sleep" to see how many of your previous

and future weeks will be spent

sleeping.
Of course, it's just an approximation,

it's difficult to know if you will have more

or fewer weeks to come.
It's hard to know when it will all end.

It's even more difficult to document, unless you are

Reynaldo Dagsa, a councilman from the Philippines,

who took this photo of his family on New Year's Day

at the very same second that he was

assassinated.
The photo was later used

to catch the killer.
We can't predict everything,

but in the event of an anticipated catastrophic

event - severe weather, an incoming nuclear attack or

asteroid - how would we all know what was going on?

Well, many countries have systems in
place to allow them to speak to as many

people as quickly as possible.

The United States has the Emergency Alert

System.
When triggered, the system

interrupts all programming on radio and television

with messages generated using text-to-speech

automated voices.
The warning tones are known,

so what's kind of scary is that today

we can take a peek

and see what it would look like and what
it would sound like

if a catastrophic event occurred.
In this example

a nuclear attack that threatened life
across the entire country.

First of all, you would likely here sirens

and then, as you went tune into, say TV,

this is what you would hear and see.

We interrupt our programming.

This is a national emergency.
The following message is transmitted at the

request of the United States government.

This is not a test. A nuclear attack is
occurring against the United States.

Four nuclear missiles have been 
launched from unknown locations

and are expected to strike the United
States within the next 15 minutes.

Due to the uncertain facts of these
missiles, all residents of the United

States should seek out

and prepare to take shelter immediately.

Stand by for a message from
the President of the United States.

If a catastrophic event occurred of global proportions,

what would humanity do next?
Well,

there might be survivors. People hidden
away in fortresses that we have built,

like

the North American Aerospace Defense Command,

NORAD.
Built into solid

granite, shielded by steel plating to
protect computer systems from

electromagnetic pulses

and supported on springs, so as to

safely sway in the event of an earthquake,
NORAD can protect

humans and equipment from a 30

megaton nuclear blast just a mile away.

After the event, it's places like this

that would literally be humanity's last,
best chance of continuing life.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is on
the Norwegian island

of Spitsbergen.
Buried 390 feet

inside a mountain, it safely stores and protects

250 million individual seeds

for growing plants and crops, if their vulnerable

living relatives on the surface are all destroyed.

Soviet technology existed to put people on the Moon,

of course, they never did.
If

Russia had sent men to the Moon,
they would have walked around on it

looking like this. The Krechet-94
was designed in 1967 but

never used for Soviet manned lunar excursion.

Russia did, however, sent the first man into space

and the first woman into outer space.

They also sent the first dog into orbit
around the Earth.

Unfortunately, the dog died too soon
after launch due to overheating.

But later they sent Belka and Strelka,

dogs on a rocket full of living
organisms that became

the very first to orbit the Earth and return to

Earth alive.
You can still see them

today.
The Moscow Cosmonautics Memorial Museum
has the two dogs

preserved.
Stuffed and on display as

physical relics of earthlings growing up

and leaving their planet.
I was also lucky enough to visit a restaurant

in Moscow with menus - yep - that used Comic Sans.

Oh, and I ate a star dog, which in the cyrillic

alphabet looks like it's called crap dosis.

The United States of course did send
people to the Moon,

but recently we have learned that NASA
at the time didn't know

with the same certainty as other variables

whether the first man on the Moon would be able

to leave. Just two days before humanity's
historic moon landing

William Safire was asked to prepare a speech

for President Nixon to read on television to the world

if Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong

became stranded on the Moon.
Thirty years later

William Safire explained that Aldrin and
Armstrong were supposed to reunite with

the command module

orbiting the moon,
but if they couldn't and there was a

good risk that they couldn't, then they would have to be

abandoned on the Moon, left to die there

and

mission control would then have to use
their euphemism

"close down communication"
and the men would have to either

starve to death or commit suicide.

And, so, we prepared for that with the

the speech that I wrote and

the President was ready to to give that.
Luckily,

Nixon never had to deliver the Moon disaster speech,

but to read it today, thinking of those two guys

still alive on the surface of the Moon

knowing that they will never get back to Earth

is chiling.
Included in that speech

were these lines: "fate has ordained

that the men who went to the Moon to
explore in peace

will stay on the Moon to rest in peace.

These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin,

know that there is no hope for their
recovery but they also know that their

is hope for mankind in their sacrifice.

In ancient days men looked at the stars
and saw their heroes

in the constellations.
In modern times we do much the same,

but our heroes are epic men of flesh

and blood.
For every human being who looks up at the moon

in the nights to come will know that there is some corner

of another world that is forever mankind."
And that's what I took away most from my

trip to Kourou.

Space isn't just a place for zero-g
tricks or imagining sci-fi technology,

space is ever-expanding

and full of corners of other worlds that could
one day become mankind's,

if we choose to.
And that doesn't minimize Earth.

The Vega rocket I went to see sent up
satellites designed to

test electric solar wind sails for
interplanetary travel,

as well as satellites built to analyze
the health of Earth's

vegetation or to predict natural disasters.

Just as our bodies benefit from having
doctors and instruments beyond them that

can

probe, investigate and diagnose, so does the earth.

Launch pads, like the one in Kourou I got to visit,

are really just hospital waiting rooms for

earth. A place where our planet can wait
for researchers and scientists

to put their tools, their instruments into use,

into orbit.
We may never know

if something will or will not happen, but by

pursuing space, corners of other worlds,

we gain a perspective that can help us shrink

the size of that mysterious and often
frightening

if.and as always

And as always,

thanks for watching.
