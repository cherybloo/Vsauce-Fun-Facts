Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

I've got a question for you.
Why did the chicken cross the road?

Brilliant question. Let's find out why.

Historically, the chicken crossed the road
to get to the other side. Has anybody ever

laughed at that joke? Why has it become so
famous? And, for that matter, who cares? Why

would you want to investigate why things are
funny? As E.B. White said "analyzing humor

is like dissecting a frog - few people are
interested, and the frog dies."

But I want to dive into the guts of this chicken
joke because today it is so famous, it is

practically shorthand for comedy. And people
frequently consider it either the worst joke

of all time or the oldest joke.
But neither of those is true.

But first things first. The chicken joke
isn't technically even a joke. It's an "anti-joke."

It's a joke about jokes. You see, we expect
a joke to surprise us, to flip things around

or use word play. But to get to the other
side is just obvious, it's mundane, which,

by itself, can be pretty funny. To make this
more clear, let's take a look at anti-joke

chicken. "What's blue and smells like red
paint? Blue paint." You see, you expect a

typical joke-y punch line, but instead what
you get is hilariously serious. Anti-Joke

Cat is another good one. "Knock knock." "Who's
there?" "Lettuce." "That's impossible."

"Yo momma's so fat, we are all extremely concerned
for her health." Anti-jokes can also be used

for psychological experiments right at home.
You may have heard of this one already, the

"no soap, radio" joke. Here's how it works.
Get a couple of your friends together and

tell them to all laugh when you're done telling
the joke, no matter what. Then, go find a

target who's not in on it and tell them some
version of a joke like this: "Two polar bears

were sitting in a bathtub. The first one says
"pass the soap." The second one says "no soap,

radio."" At this point, you and your friends
should start laughing uproariously, meaning

the target has one of two choices- either
be afraid of looking dumb and laugh along

anyway or say they're confused, at which
point you should tell them "what, you don't

get it?" and keep laughing. You wait until
the target gives into peer pressure and succumbs

to mob mentality and joins, despite the fact
that "no soap, radio" is actually nonsense.

As for being the oldest joke in the book,
"why did the chicken cross the road?" is far

from it. Tt's only about 160 some odd-years
old. It first appeared in print in The Knickerbocker

as a conundrum that really isn't one - an anti-joke.
If you want to look for the oldest joke ever

to appear in print, we're going to have to
go back 4,000 years to read some ancient Sumerian

proverbs.

The joke is essentially a cautionary tale
to never expect anything to be perfect. It

goes like this: "Something which has never
occurred since time immemorial: a young woman

did not fart in her husband's embrace." So...yeah,
the earliest known joke is a joke about a

woman farting in a guy's lap. So...cool...

All I'm sure of is that our proverbial chicken
did not have Agyrophobia. That's the fear of crossing

streets. But maybe the chicken should have.
I mean, crossing the road could be quite dangerous

for a little bird, which leads us to a quite
darker interpretation of the joke. Maybe this

chicken knew of the danger of crossing the
road. Maybe he knew what could happen. Maybe

he was sad or lonely or knew what his fate
was. And so he decided to take control and

end it himself 
and crossed the road to get to the other side.

and the site will generate a countdown of
the number of seconds you likely have left

to live. You can just sit there and watch
them tick away. But let's get back to the

joke.

Perhaps a better question than "why did the
chicken cross the road" is "why wouldn't chickens

be crossing the road?" I mean, to be sure,
the Earth is a big place and less than 1

percent of it is even paved, but there are
quite a few chickens on Earth.

To put this in perspective, there are about
500 million cats and, as far as we go, there

are 7 billion humans. But chickens?
There are 24 billion chickens. We're outnumbered

more than 3:1. But if we cooked up every
single chicken alive on Earth right now, we

could fill enough KFC 16-piece buckets to
form a stack of them going to the Moon and

back three times. Unbelievable, right?
I mean, they all fit so nicely here on Earth's

surface, walking around with their characteristically
lean meat, which, because fat contributes so

much more flavor to a piece of meat than the
muscle does, may explain why chicken is such

a great generic meat flavor and why so many
other exotic meats we try later tend to taste

like chicken.

But let's get back to the question in this
video's title. Why did the chicken cross the

road? Well, to get to the other side, sure,
but there are many different motivations a

chicken could have for going to the other
side. Maybe it was looking for food, maybe

it was being chased by a predator. What matters
though is that we can never know because there

is no chicken. It's purely hypothetical, as
opposed to the equally famous "Mary Had a

Little Lamb," in which the lamb,
and Mary, were real people.

Mary Sawyer was an actual student at The Redstone
School in Massachusetts and one day her brother

encouraged her to bring her lamb to school.
Her fellow students were amused, as was visiting

student John Roulstone
who wrote "Mary Had a Little Lamb."

We have actual documentation of those real
people and events, but this chicken never

even really existed. So, asking why the chicken
crossed the road is just like asking "why

did the original writer decide that it should
be a chicken crossing a road?" Which means

that the chicken crossed the road because some
comedian in the 19th century decided that

you would probably think about it too much,
making the mundane "to get to the other side"

answer quite surprising.

To explain this, let's look at a computational
neural explanation of humor. In order to effectively

manage resources, our brains stay a few steps
ahead of what we're hearing, estimating what

kind of outcomes are possible. But when we
discover that we're actually being told a

joke, and none of our paths were the correct
version of what was being told, all of that

neural network energy needs to dissipate
and according to some theorists, that energy

moves into motor cortex,
causing convulsions - laughter.

Unfortunately, our poor chicken friend doesn't
illicit that response from us anymore because

we've all heard the joke. We know what to
expect when the joke begins. But we should

be proud of our chicken friend and the unknown
author who thought him up, because even though

the joke is so famous it's no longer funny,
even at a neurological level, it still stands

as a testament to just how complicated and
clever our comedy can be. Keep laughing.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
