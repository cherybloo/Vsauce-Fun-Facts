you guys asked for it so here it is

whether it's Mario Brothers from Mario's

perspective or a girl gamer who seems to

be saying yeah size does matter it could

only mean one thing

episode 2 of IMG this week

BuzzFeed brought us some of the best

pictures of the moment a baseball hits

someone's face and then what the H how

about some baseball bats - speaking of

pictures taken at just the right time

here's the Google Streetview camera

splattered with bird poop on Sunset

Boulevard in LA if you want to explore

the bird poop as it happened there's a

link in the description to the actual

Street View image as well as every

single image in this show BAM right off

the bat I'm going to break the rules and

show some video clips because let's be

serious why the H not these clips were

featured on our lest this week and they

are the most unnecessary inventions

right now you're watching a grass

treadmill but they also had a machine

whose only function was to unplug itself

and a banana fan all right back to still

images but not that still I first saw

this image in a psychology class and I

revisited it this week because of Moe

illusions calm move your eyes around and

you will see the image rotate and move

seriously pause the video and keep

looking pretty freaky right moe

illusions also had this really cool

picture of Albert Einstein or is it step

away from your screen like 10 feet away

and the picture will magically transform

into Marilyn Monroe go back up close and

bam it's Albert Einstein again

maybe they're real maybe they're

photoshopped you guys tell me what you

think but they are MC escher styled

impossible structures made out of Legos

whatever it is they're really cool back

to BuzzFeed this collection is really

hot today and it is titled proof geeks

are sexy now we're going to transition

from sexy to tiny and slimy which in my

case is the same thing this picture is

super popular on NIDA Rama scientists

discovered the world's smallest ever

frog nope not that one smaller BAM there

it is look at that guy there were some

great suggestions over at facebook.com

slash Vsauce gaming Lucas submitted what

is both the funniest and the scariest

video game glitch mod acid trip whatever

you want to call it I've ever seen and

speaking of one-eyed monsters Isiah gave

us this fantastic Wow screen cap now

look at the tar and his title is the

patient

something tells me death flowers not

that good do you want something scary

Derek gave us this picture which I'm

guessing is the first Thanksgiving and

back to something sexy Kazi has

submitted this photoshop of Sylvanas on

the cover of Cosmopolitan it's an entire

Azeroth issue so be sure to read all of

the titles on it and just that fast it's
