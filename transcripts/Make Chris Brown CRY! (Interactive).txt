hey thank you thank you thank you

everybody oh thank you how's it going

guys I apologize that the video quality

isn't better I'm actually broadcasting

from Kansas right now which is where I

grew up I've been celebrating the fourth

with family but I wanted you to see

something an interactive YouTube game I

made with annotations about a year ago

with Chris Brown and Rihanna if you

haven't already played the game I want

you guys to play it now because in just

a a short while I am going to be making

a brand new interactive YouTube game

just for Vsauce and it is going to be a

firstperson shooter so be sure to

subscribe so you can be one of the first

people to play it what you're about to

see is going to be a little bit

backwards you are actually going to see

what happens when you lose the Chris

Brown Game Chris Brown and Rihanna are

going to get married forever but don't

worry it's not too late you're going to

get two options that show up one is

going to be to subscribe to Vsauce which

you should already have done and the

second option option is to throw more

stuff at Chris Brown to save Rihanna
