Vsauce good to see you all here a few

weeks ago I saw it in your sleep

submitted a great Fallout 3 glitch and

by great I mean booty shaken I was so

inspired I decided to cover some more

bauce video game wtfs and first off

Fallout New Vegas where right off the

bat this guy likes to get

creepy in Madden NFL 11 you can get hit

in the nuts where's the ball you ask

this guy has magic ball returning nuts

the only thing more fun is playing

basketball ball topless but be careful

where you blow things up or you might

get this and be careful when you cheat

and portal this guy tried third person

and wound up with a gun in the butt

don't worry he changed it to a crowbar

and now mashups here's one you'll love

Pokemon in Fallout New Vegas apparently

they'll just follow you around and fight

on your side now what's this guy riding

through San Andreas a scooter a segue no

no no Sonic the Hedgehog but my favorite

combination is Super Mario World meeting

portal now Mario doesn't get a portal

gun but he can use what's there and just

like the original it's all very puzzle

based Brown water kills you and the cute

little turret guys are bullet bills by

the way a Reddit user pretty much won

the internet last week with these

mirrors modded with backlights to look

like real life portals now consider some

console and PC mods a few are just

cosmetic like alligator skin with an

eyeball others are microwave PCS

complete with an ins inside a microwave

desktop wallpaper but if you're scared

of the radiation just warm up with a

toaster instead a working super nin

toaster we've all seen the massive NES

tabletop controller but thinking smaller

here's an NES game playing inside the

cartridge itself but let's say you own a

Dreamcast a Nintendo 64 an Xbox an Atari

2600 a Sega Saturn and NES and S NES and

a PlayStation how do you organize them

all easy in inside the ultimate gaming

machine R2-D2 you can turn any website

into a Katamari Fun Zone by copy and

pasting the JavaScript code in this

video's description into your browser's

url bar it works best in Chrome but when

you press enter you will be able to use

your mouse to move around a ball that

picks up items on the page and grows

larger the bigger it gets the larger the

objects it can pick up before we leave

what modifications would you want for

your own system a PS3 that cooks you

bacon an Xbox that you can make out with

take to the prom leave your ideas in the

comments below and once you have go

check out my new episode of boat on

Vsauce 2 where I show you the world's

biggest holes click right here for that

and as always thanks for
