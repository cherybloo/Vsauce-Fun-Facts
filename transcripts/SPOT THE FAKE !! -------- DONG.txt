Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
coming from Kansas for the 4th of July.

Why Kansas? Well, because out here you can
do anything. You can even put a firework

store

next to a gas station. But enough about
the real world, let's talk about DONGs,

things you can do online now guys. 
If your style is minimalist, play Nathan's

recommendation,

the Level Game. It's really simple,
but gets increasingly reliant on

you being clever. This Wesaucer
asked if there's a way to detect whether

an image has been

Photoshopped. One of my favorites is
Error Level Analysis.com

This site will automatically convert
your image to a known quality

and then compare. The higher the quality
the jpeg the better.

Here's a picture of Bruce Willis's
daughter with a Photoshopped version on

the right.

Notice all the activity around her face
and chin. Gotcha,

a fake. I've been playing a lot of iRunner
lately but for a similar

browser-based running game,

"Adamdre" says 'Kawairun.'
Jump, slide,

survive. "FraserGodfrey" pointed me to a
great site where you can choose fun

ASCII fonts and then it will turn whatever you
type into neat ASCII

art you can copy and paste into e-mails,
websites, forums, wherever.

The very same site has a typing test,
which I know sounds kinda lame,

but you can practice your speed and
after the test see a heat map

of which letters you type the fastest and
which ones are your weakest.

If you want some music,
check out 'Undo' from The Half Pennies.

Wait for it. Vsauce. There are some other
references to YouTubers hidden

throughout

and if you have time, try to find them all.

If you're sick of flat music videos,
"MegaUltranerd" told me about

this music video, where you can use your
cursor to click and drag your

perspective around

to see other parts of the scene.
But now let's get psychic with

"Linkfirexs." 'Akinator' is classic,
but he still blows my mind.

Think of a character and
actor, singer, scientist, cartoon

superhero,

whoever.
Answer his simple questions and watch his

eerie brilliance shine through.
If you never leave the house, you might like

Bars of black-and-white,

an awesome point-and-click about a sad
guy who receives a barcode scanner

that can scan some things you wouldn't expect.
Or

stay indoors and inside your games with
'Candy Catch,'

a neat little webcam-based game where you navigate
your body through reversed and flipped

images to grab the candy and not

the dangerous pumpkins. Alright, that
does it for games, but on Saturday I went

down to Joplin, Missouri

to help out.
It's been more than a month since the tornado hit

and this is how things look now.
The preciseness of the storm

is so chilling. On one side of the street
houses are together

and on the other they're not.
But of course, there are DONGs you can do about

it.

You can donate and you can also learn
about tornadoes and tornado safety.

Stay safe this 4th of July.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
