Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And today I released a brand new

Vsauce Leanback. A playlist of
educational videos from all over YouTube

that I think are cool

and I host sort of like a Vsauce TV show.
You can start that by clicking the box up in

the corner

or the link at the top of this video's
description. But before that,

I wanna talk about the Shepard tone.
It's a sound

made out of multiple sine waves that
play a trick on us.

See, what they do is continuously rise in pitch

and then every so often one of them
drops down an octave,

but our brains don't perceive that because
the other two

continue rising and cover for it.
The sine waves take turns dropping down an

octave,

producing a sonic barber pole, a noise

that appears to keep rising in pitch for
ever and ever

without ever actually going anywhere.

I was reminded of it this week by
FallingFalling.com,

a creation of Internet artist New Rafael,
where the Shepard tone

seems to go down and fall forever.

Rafael also made some other cool sites,
like OutInTheWind.com.

Here, there's nothing except for dismissing

wind that slowly erodes your cursor. Okay, now
some of you may already know this, but in

America

we say "ADIdas," whereas the rest of the world says

"adiDAS." And no, it does not stand for "all
day I dream about soccer."

That's just a backronym, an acronym made
up for a word that already exists.

Instead, it's named after a person, which
is why people pronounce "adiDAS."

It's named after Adi Dassler, a German guy
who got in a fight with his brother,

so his brother rude off, went across the
river and started his own athletic company,

known as PUMA.
That's right. Adidas

and Puma came from the same town,
from the same

family. Finally, before the Leanback, I
wanna share this USB typewriter with you.

It's a really cool device

that plugs into your computer and works
like a normal keyboard, except at the

same time

it keeps a hard copy for your records.
It even works with an iPad.

Alright, now it's time to watch the
Vsauce Leanback. You can click here

to start it.

I'll meet you over there.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
