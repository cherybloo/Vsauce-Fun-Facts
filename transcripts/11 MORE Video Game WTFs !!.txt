Vsauce you're probably checking out my

clip-on flip-up shades of thinking to

yourself WTF which is exactly what we're

talking about today these houses covered

video game WTF twice already but we only

barely scratch the surface so without

further ado get ready for more

Vsauce WTF first stop the age-old

question where do babies come from in

Minecraft you might think it's based on

spawn timers or in some cases hot fixes

or hatches but no apparently they do it

the old-fashioned way speaking of

amazing feats of strength check out

spider-man's dive into the ocean ah the

forum excellent

oops grand theft auto san andreas gives

us the opposite of a faceplant it's

important to open your parachute early

before you die unless of course you

never stop falling

this one's famous a guy pushes a goat

and forces it to climb a ladder but

what's famous about the clip isn't the

goat it's the guys laughs and yes you're

reading that correctly his laugh about

that one glitch lasts for more than nine

minutes whoa hey hey hey hey

my druids not leveled high enough for me

to test this so I don't know if they

fixed it yet but if you switch to flight

form and then join a dungeon that you

can mount it like oculus mount and then

immediately leave the dungeon boom you

are in flight form and mountain

[Music]

Age of Conan has some pretty girls but

part of this girl's body seems possessed

in that good way watch closely

if you like you're twitching less subtle

check out this guy from stalker or if

you want it more deliberate check out

this thing players can customise the

pitching stance and the windup and it

looks like the sky's the limit

here's my favorite dancing dancing

dancing [ __ ] remember game genie well

this guy found a code that makes

everything act like a hammer brother but

in conclusion here's something that is

the most annoying when reality stops

working

luckily he does finally come to rest on

the ground just kidding it gets weirder

we've got way more Vsauce video game WTF

coming soon but in the meantime tell me

in the comments below what was the last

thing that made you say WTF can't wait

to hear them and as always thanks for

watching
