[Music]

and in the spirit of halloween check out

these hair oh lanterns funzu showed us

art on nails these kind of nails

delicious refreshing pokey sorry pokemon

browsy and trekkie but now let's just

talk about thumbnails the youtube kind

you may have been impressed that i

managed to fit two girls on this video's

thumbnail well not quite it's just one

girl abby and brittany hensel share two

hearts but just one body i'd heard about

them before but it wasn't until

yesterday that i found this treasure

trove of pictures of them if you want to

see a video about the girls check the

link in the description below which is

where you'll find links to all the

images in this show in the video the

girls say they're interested in dating

and yesterday i found some great dating

advice

first shower with some beer soap and

beer shampoo dress formally light a

romantic beer-scented candle or eat by

the light of a chandelier finish off

with some beer cupcakes trade mp3s and

if you die of alcohol poisoning get

buried in one of these

and gift break

dummage.com assembled a treasury of

animals with their heads or more stuck

this one actually happened to me in

college

when i heard 8-bit wood i thought i'd

fit right in but no it's really just

that wood sculptures of 8-bit wonders

but now it's time machine time via

blaster keanu reeves bruce willis samuel

l jackson george lucas and jean-claude

van damme damn these women used to be

these men so here's a challenge from the

annual optical illusion contest can you

tell which one of these is a man and

which is a woman

trick question they're the exact same

face but this one has higher than normal

contrast and this one lower than normal

it's not actually clear yet why this

makes such a difference ambiguams are

designs that can be read as one word or

more from different viewpoints rotate

this word and look it still says

ambigram play hard light is a particle i

mean wave oh look my name

and come in go away for this one sit a

comfortable distance from the shape then

move your face right up next to it it

will appear to become brighter and then

darker as you move back away just like

contrast and gender the reason for this

illusion is not quite known yet but look

at this a bra that can be turned into a

gas mask and while these cats morph into

croissants i'm going to shout out
