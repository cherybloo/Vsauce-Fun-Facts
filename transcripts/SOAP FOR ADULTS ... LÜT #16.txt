Go to sleep in a chocolate bar or a can of sardines

and an infectious disease stress ball

that you can squish.
It's episode 16

of LÃœT.

Are you tired of wimpy straws that make
you look like a loser?

Well, grab ThinkGeek's food grade Titanium straw.

It tears into fruit like metal justice.
Keep being awesome with this mirror decal

that makes you look like the star
of a press conference. Or

these decals you can use to let guests
accessorise themselves by standing

just the right way. Keep a stash of
temporary stache-tous handy

to quickly turn your finger into what
you must...stache.

Then lay back on your hamburger bean
bag. It's not cheap,

but come, a diamond-shaped bean bag?
That's almost as classy

as liquor scented soaps.
Your butt is not clean

until it smells like a whiskey sour.
Also on Etsy are these adorable punk kitties

Hank

e-mailed me about. His friend makes them
and he says each one is handmade and

completely unique,

there will never be another one like it.
Speaking of e-mail,

these Air Swimmers also wound up in my
inbox. Remote-controlled

floating balloons you can scare cats with.
But if you're sick of e-mailing

you're gonna love today's free thing.
Snail Mail

My Email is a project started by Ivan Cash.
All you have to do

is send an email with the recipient's address

to snailmailmyemail@gmail.com by

August 15th. A team of volunteers will then
hand-write your message

and mail it to who you say. Write your
own awesome messages in this notebook,

where instead of blank paper you're given
blank New York City walls and trucks

that your notes and doodles can deface.

As a final escape from modern technology,
transform your iPhone 4

into an old leather book and then enter the future

with this amazing Levitron I found on Vat19. 
It can hold objects up to

12 ounces

and automatically adjusts when they move
or change weight.

Here's a wine stopper that makes the
bottle look like a message in a bottle,

but if you prefer your potent portables quantifiable,

use this glass, which has markings
designating exact servings

of spirits, beer and wine. 
Beastie Boys action figures,

a spoon action figure, a miniature camera
that's a USB flash drive

and a flash drive that's... fresh.

Beans can be fun when they come in a can.

Water this and when the seed grows
it'll sprout with a message written on

it.

If you live in or near London,
I'm gonna be there this weekend

at Summer in the City. It's an awesome
get together for cool people

and cool YouTubers
and if you can make it, I'll be there -

Vsauce unite. Speaking of Vsauce,
are you subscribed to be Vsauce2

yet? If not, you're missing out on
knowledge. There's a brand new episode of

Mind Blow over there right now.

So, what are you waiting for?

And as always,

thanks for watching.
