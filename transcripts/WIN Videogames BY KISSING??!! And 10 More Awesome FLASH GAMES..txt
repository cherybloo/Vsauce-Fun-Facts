yesterday everyone was talking about a

new game controlled by kissy one person

has a magnet stuck on their tongue and

the position and speed of their tongue

controls the direction and speed of a

bowling ball but until and if that game

hits stores let's wait it out with 10

interactive things that you can play

right now in the description meaty boner

is a game where you're a skeleton who

throws your skull to stun and then you

punch stuff out and throw your skull

again to eat it up and literally put

meat on your bones by the way you can

collect power-ups like fire which does

well it does this flaming boner the

silly names don't stop there go check

out don't [ __ ] your pants where the

title is your only goal you type

directions and try your best to not make

a mess in your pants uh let's try check

out vsauce i don't know how to check out

vsauce okay let's try fart dang it okay

but trust me though there is a way to

win let's add an f and play shift in

this game you have to press the shift

key to invert the world the black ground

and white background reverse roles so

you can creatively exploit the puzzle

world and reach the door

most of you have probably already played

mario crossover it's an exact copy of

super mario brothers except you can play

as other nes characters like bill from

contra and even use their original

weapons and moves but look if you want

your mashups more trippy download and

install rom check fail this game is only

for pc and linux but as you play the

world it glitches out between classic

arcade games and you have to just keep

playing

[Music]

it was created in three weeks during an

independent gaming competition

the sagittarian is a point-and-click

adventure which quizzes you on your

ability to survive a zombie apocalypse

and has an even greater buzzkill this

new adventure game lets you make normal

real-life decisions as if you were a

low-income family and if you can't pay

rent at the end of the game you're

homeless

this is the only level is a game that

contains only one level which you have

to keep playing over and over again with

slightly different rules and controls

each time it starts off easy and gets

weirder and weirder

finally take a break from playing games

and listen to music ishker's guide is

really old but if you haven't used it

yet it's awesome the website gives you a

graphical flowchart of electronic music

styles by decade and influence and even

lets you read about and listen to

samples from each genre

i bring it up because yesterday jake

showed me map of metal.com here you can

browse well a map of metal also

organized by year genre and with an

incredible amount of songs for each

different style

in the comments let me know which exact

sub-genre of music is your personal

favorite get specific and check out all

these interactive things in the

description if you do well come back

here and let us know how well you did

and let us know that you wear the pants

okay i'm going to fix that picture but

until next time

thanks for watching
