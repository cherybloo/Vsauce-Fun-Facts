tattoo no not a cornea tattoo but a

tattoo on the inside of the upper lip

that lets you do this we've had a lot of

cool illusions on the show and a few

last episode of IMG I tricked some of

you into touching my butt well guess

what

YouTube remembers if you touched my butt

and liked it YouTube knows your name and

has added you to the registry of butt

touches you'll know you're on the list

because all of a sudden this video will

just freeze and you'll have to

okay now that the butt touches are gone
