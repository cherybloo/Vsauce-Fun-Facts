swimming thank you thank you welcome to

up all night I'm a knight I'm a horse

nay we've got a great show for you today

topic number one games and apples apples

don't come with very many games loaded

on them or do they try this open up

terminal applications utilities terminal

type in emac press enter hold down

escape and press X and then type in

Tetris boom you can also type in pong

Solitaire and Uncharted 2 meow just

kidding nay but don't worry if you ever

see someone playing emac Tetris and you

fear they may beat your high score

simply run over to their computer and

hold down command option eject their

computer will go to sleep in a matter of

seconds and even though it's just asleep

and no data is lost for all they know

you completely bricked

it the next time you're at a page where

text is masked like the way passwords

are

copy and paste code number one from this

video's description into your browser's

url bar and press enter as soon as you

do that all masked text will become

unmasked and everything put into that

text field from now on will be visible

copy code number two from this video's

description and paste it into a text

editor like notepad then save the

document as a VBS file put it right on

the desktop by opening this file you

will cause a NeverEnding dialogue box to

appear the secret dis stopping it is to

press control alt delete and end the

process W script but come on we can do

better than that copy code number three

from this video's description and paste

it into a text editor like notepad save

the file as a VBS right click on the

file and create a shortcut on your

desktop now let's have a little bit of

fun with people who use Internet

Explorer rename and change the icon so

that the shortcut looks like Internet

Explorer but here's the trick when the

icon is double clicked sure enough

Internet Explorer launches but what your

victim doesn't know is that every 8

seconds his or her computer is going to

type the phrase I eat donkey balls

whether they're searching for Bieber

wallpapers are emailing their poor sweet

grandmother every 8 seconds against

their will I eat donkey balls boom right

there and finally let's end with the

YouTube Easter egg some of you may have

already known this but if you pause a

YouTube video and then use the arrow

keys left and right to go back and forth

and Force the video to buffer you can

break the spinning buffer balls and play

a little game of

worm before we go is the most important

part of the show here are three links to

check out even if they keep you up all
