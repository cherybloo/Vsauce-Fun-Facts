Blockhead bunnies and disembodied cat
unicorn princesses.

It's episode 40 of IMG!

You've gotta be careful around ducks.

Seriously. But it's okay to be smug

with a panda.
If you've got extra time carve Lincoln

out of Oreo filling.
Or check out more of Sam

Spratt's work. He recently made some 
awesome mean faces.

Forever alone is good too. It's also good
as a costume. If you can't afford

costumes, here's how to be a table.

It really, I mean, it's safer than trying
to sit with a dog around.

But let's move on to a famous photo.
This Windows desktop image

has a title. It's called "Bliss" and was
taken in 1996 by a man named

Charles O'Rear in Sonoma County, California.
Now, since the photo was taken

a vineyard has moved in and today
the hill looks like

this. Let's get mappy. This map shows what
people call soft drinks.

Blue is where they say 'pop,'
yellow is where they say 'soda'

and red is where they tend to call all soft drinks

'coke.' Now this map bloats up and squeezes
countries based on the size

of their annual GDP, the total market
value of all goods and services the

country produces in a year.

Notice how small the African continent
is, even though it's actually

quite large.
Seriously, you could fit

United States inside Africa along with
Europe, India,

China, Japan and more.
By the way,

the diameter of the Moon is
approximately the length

of the United States of America,
which means that roughly, to scale,

this is the size of the Moon.
And finally,

this map shows the remoteness of areas of the world.

The darker the region,
the further away it is from a large city.

But if you really wanna get away, 
climb to the top of Chimborazo in

Ecuador.

It's not the tallest mountain in the
world, but because the Earth

bulges slightly in the middle and it's
a big mountain near the equator,

its peak is actually the furthest point on

Earth from the center of the Earth.
Now, a bunch of dogs

shaking off water.
Enjoy.

Okay, here's a trick. If you wanna know
where an image came from or find other

versions or sizes,

go to Google Image Search and drag the picture

right into your browser.
Boom. Success.

And if you wanna lose your mind,
there are plenty of GIFs to do it,

but I'll recommend ScillyMission's Swirl page.

Move your cursor around and feel powerful or

nauseous.
Of course, the best cure for nausea is

eating a baby. Right, grandma? Oh boy.
Instead, let's just wear slippers

shaped like babies. And here's something
huge. In our explosion video I mentioned

the US's Pacific atomic tests

and then yesterday I came across this
incredible real photo of the beach

and in the distance an atomic underwater detonation.

It's pretty terrifying.
Just a few hours ago

Vsauce surpassed 300,000 subscribers,

which is awesome.
You guys rule and

the Vsauce team will continue to bring

As always,

thanks for watching.
