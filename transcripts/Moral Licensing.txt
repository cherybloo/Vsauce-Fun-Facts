Moral psychology isn't always
an easy thing to study.

First of all,
just using a survey

to ask people
what they think is moral

doesn't always reveal what they
would do in real life.

An experiment that actually
puts people

in what feels like
a real scenario

may get more realistic results,

but researchers must always
balance the benefits

of what we could learn

with the safety and well-being
of the people they study.

Secondly, what we learn from
moral psychology experiments

doesn't always make humans
look good.

For example, today we're going
to look at moral licensing:

the theory that when you do
something good...

you subconsciously feel
you've earned a license

to then do something bad.

 I've been working
 with Dr. Kyle Stanford,

 from the Department of Logic
 and Philosophy of Science

 at the University
 of California, Irvine,

 on a way to observe
 moral licensing in the wild.

So I want to see moral licensing
in effect.

I want to see people
who have been led to believe,

through their own actions,
that they're good.

Use that feeling

to do bad.

The thing to keep in mind,

it's like people
are keeping tabs,

and they give themselves credit
for the moral...

the good thing they did.

But none of that is happening
consciously, right?

So we shouldn't imagine
that a person who's engaged

in moral licensing is asking
themselves in their head...

Right, pulling out
their scorecard.

...what should I be?
Does it make me a good person?

But it is going on,
and they don't experience it.

-They don't know that it's
happening. 
-Right.

I think we're going to learn
a lot today.

-I say we go get started.
 -Let's do it.

Let's do it.

[Michael] So here's how
 the moral licensing test

 we designed is going to work.

 First, we're going to take
 this beautiful park

 and, for the purposes
 of science,

 throw trash everywhere.

 Next, we've hired
 some unsuspecting actors

 who think they're going to film
 a public service announcement

 about the park.

-Hey, Jake. Hey, man.
-Hi.

-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

 Once they've arrived,

 it will be obvious
 that the trash is a problem.

We just need to clean up this
little alleyway right here.

 Will they do a good deed
 and earn some moral credit

 by volunteering to help
 pick up the trash, or not?

 And to make everything
 feel more real,

 we did have them film
 our fake PSA.

Forget the concrete
and the heat.

Relax in over
16,000 square feet.

Of outdoor space
that can't be beat.

Right outside your door.

Right outside
your door.

Right outside your door.

 After shooting the PSA,

 each participant will be asked
 to wait in a separate area

 for some final paperwork.

 There, our confederate Cameron,
 who appears to be homeless,

 will ask them for money.

 Meanwhile, Dr. Stanford and I
 will be watching

 behind the scenes to observe
 how our subjects react.

 So, will our participants

 keep their subconscious
 moral scorecards balanced

 by giving money
 when they didn't clean,

 or feeling like they don't need
 to give money if they did?

-Hey!
-Makaylo.

Makaylo, nice to meet you.

 First up in our demo
 was Makaylo.

 We used our actual
 Mind Field crew

 as the crew of the fake PSA

 who are overwhelmed
 with the task

 of cleaning up
 all the trash.

We normally sort of
never ask this, but...

we've got, like, all this stuff
that we're trying to clean up.

I'm going to grab some gloves.
I was wondering,

would you help me?

-I'm sorry...
-Let's do it. Let's do it.

All three of us
can triple-team it.

-and we can get this thing
going.
-Let's do it. Let's do it.

Yeah, this is just
what we wanted to do today.

It looks like someone
had a good time, though.

[Michael] All right,
so picking up the trash.

How do you think
that's currently sitting

with our actor?

He's thinking of himself as
having done a good deed

that he didn't need to do,
that he didn't have to do.

Right? And so the moral credit
is high.

[Michael] Then it was time
 to shoot our PSA.

[man]
Take it away.

Forget the concrete
and the heat.

Relax in 16,000
square feet.

[man]
That was great! All right, man.

-Hey, thanks so much.
-Cool. No problem, man.

 We compensated our participants
 for the PSA in small bills

 so they would have plenty
 to give the homeless man,

 should they choose to do so.

-Here's $50.
-Thank you, thank you.

 Then we asked them to wait
 in a nearby tent

 for their final paperwork.

 Will Makaylo's good deed
 be enough moral credit

 for him to pass on
 helping the homeless guy?

All right, Cameron,
this is Michael.

You can go ahead.

What's up?

-What's up?
-Hi.

Are you with this?

Yeah, I'm just waiting
for someone to help me out here.

Could you help me out
with like a dollar or two?

Just, I can go
to the vending machine?

Sorry, my man, I ain't
got nothing but $20 bills on me
right now.

Oh, I got nothing
but $20 bills.

[laughs]

-You sure?
-Yeah, man.

All right, well...

[Michael]
We're going to go talk to him.

Hey, Makaylo.

-Hey.
-Thanks for waiting.

-I'm Michael. Nice to meet you.
-No problem. Makaylo.

-This is Kyle.
-Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you,
Makaylo.

We really appreciate
your help today.

-I just saw-- Did a guy come by?
-Yes.

What did he ask?

-For a dollar bill.
-[Michael] Oh, for a dollar
bill?

Yeah.

Did you give him money?

-No.
-What'd you tell him?

I just told him
I didn't have anything.

So I'm going to debrief you
on what we're doing here today.

We're doing a psychological
exploratory experiment

on what's called
moral licensing.

We're looking at the correlation
between people

who do volunteer to help
pick up the trash,

and how generous you are later

to a homeless person
who walks by.

Interesting.

Now, you just exhibited
the exact pattern

of moral licensing, right?

In that you had already
done a good deed--

So I was good for the day.
Right.

[Michael]
 Did we just see

 moral licensing in effect?

 Perhaps.

 Let's see what
 our other subjects do.

Here, let me just have you
hang out here.

Is there anybody
that can help us clean up this?

-I'm going to go look around.
-All right.

Okay, so this is Alex.

And Alex is just messing
with his stuff.

[Kyle]
He's either not really noticing,

or pretending not to notice.

But all of that is just fine.

The question is
what he then goes on to do.

[Michael] So Alex didn't help
 pick up trash.

 Will his guilt put him
 at a moral deficit,

 and therefore motivate him to
 give money to the homeless man?

Hey.

Can you spare some money?
Maybe help me out?

-You want a buck?
-A buck? Yeah.

Can I give you a buck?
Is that cool?

[Cameron]
That's more than cool, man.

I just got paid to be here.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Helping to shoot a PSA, yeah.

Where do I sign up?

-Thank you.
-All right, take care.

All right.
Very interesting.

I do wonder if he felt
a little bit of guilt.

We got it in the opposite
direction,

-which was going to be
the hard thing to do.
-Yeah.

I'm very happy about this.

[Michael]
Next, we have Jake.

So I'm on set doing a PSA shoot.

[Michael]
Hey, he's doing a vlog.

And I get here,
and it appears

that someone had a...
what could only be described

as a trash party.

I mean, they just threw trash
literally everywhere,

all over where they want
to shoot.

So I'm going to go help them
pick up some of the trash.

First, I'm going to make sure
that I document

that I'm a helper.

I would also like to point out,
though, that he has not helped.

-[Kyle] Right.
-He's gone back into the tent.

And I wonder, when it comes
to moral licensing,

does this play an effect?

I can check the box.
Not only am I good,

but the world knows I'm good.

Now, this is something
we haven't seen before.

[Michael]
I love this.

I love that he got credit
for helping,

-but didn't.
-Right.

What's interesting
but hard to know

is how that'll look to him,

whether he'll see himself
as having done a good deed,

or seeing himself as kind of
skated on the obligation,

because he didn't
really help.

Hey, do you think
you could spare some money,

maybe help me out?

Here, man.
Here's a dollar.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Go for it.

All right, you're a good man.
Thank you.

We were really curious as we
were watching this all unfold,

because you agreed to help,
and then you recorded a video

about how you were
going to help,

but by the time all that
was over,

you didn't need to help.

It was all cleaned up.

-Right.
-So we were wondering,

did you feel like
you had helped, or not?

No. I didn't have time to.

And you didn't feel guilty.

Like, ooh, I kind of like
got out of helping.

No, I didn't feel bad
about that.

I would have definitely
picked up trash.

Erin's likely to be thinking
that she's doing a good deed.

Yeah.

Could you maybe help me out,
give me some money?

I'm sorry, I don't have
anything on me here.

-No?
-They won't let me.

-Oh.
-Yeah.

-That was great.
-Yes, we have a couple

good illustrations
in both directions.

[Michael] We seemed to have
 witnessed moral licensing

 at play in several cases.

 But, of course, as with
 any demonstration like this,

 our results weren't always
 cut-and-dry.

I'm going to go try
to clean this up myself,

and then...

Gotcha. Yeah, yeah.

 Some of the participants
 both didn't help clean

 and declined to give
 our homeless man money.

Could you maybe
spare some change?

I just want to go
to the vending machine?

Uh...

 However, they did find
 other ways to help hiim

 that could qualify
 as a good deed.

They have snacks, maybe.

I'm going
to take a pop.

[laughs]
Okay.

Do you want a soda
or something?

Yeah, that'd be...

Do you maybe have a little
money as well?

-I don't, sorry. But...
-Okay.

...which one
do you want?

So what was going
through your mind

when you made the decision
not to give

some of the cash
that we know you had

to the man who was asking?

You know, there's just like
a whole bunch of stereotypes

about homeless people.

And you don't know
what you're getting into.

[Michael]
 And we had a couple subjects

 who both volunteered to clean
 and gave money.

Do you need any
assistance?

If you wouldn't mind,
that'd be really helpful.

[Michael]
Oh, he's offering to help. Oh!

-Do you need any help?
-Oh, would you mind?

-[Kyle] Oh, she just offered.
She offered.
-[Michael] She's volunteered.

 These were the only two
 participants

 who did good deeds
 at both opportunities.

-[man] Thank you so much for the
help. 
-[Diana] Of course.

-Do you maybe have some spare
change? 
-Here you go.

-Thanks a lot.
-Best of luck.

-Here you go. Hope it helps.
-Thank you so much.

You're welcome.

[Michael]
All right, let's go talk to her.

Another good,
good person.

What motivated you
to give the man money?

I actually tend to give people
money often.

I don't know if that's
the best thing.

Interesting.

 So two people both cleaned
 and donated money.

 But everyone else either
 cleaned and didn't give,

 or didn't clean,
 but gave in some form.

What do you think
about how everything went?

Well, it was really interesting.
I would like to do it with many
more people.

But I think we saw
the phenomenon, right?

We saw the thing happen.

Something we weren't expecting,
actually,

is sort of the gap between
what people did

and what they said
about why they did it.

-Yeah.
-Right? And that's something--

I mean, social psychology
generally has learned

to be very suspicious
of people's rationales

or justifications
for their own behavior.

But these actually fit
kind of nicely.

You could see people straining
to defend themselves

if they didn't do a good deed
that was open to them.

Right? And then a lot of people
who did good deeds had the,

"Well, of course, that's what
anyone would do" attitude.

-Right?
-[Michael] Yeah.

 I believe our study

 successfully created
 the conditions

 for moral licensing
 to emerge.

 It was a great first step

 towards taking
 this kind of study

 out of the lab
 and into the real world.

 But, of course, many people
 already have a philosophy

 about giving to the homeless
 that might be stronger

 than the impact
 of a good deed they do.

 So we're not done yet.

Now, here's what I want
to do next, okay?

We learned a lot
of lessons today,

and I think one of them is that
when the scenarios

you put people in

are scenarios they may have
experienced before,

that can affect
the results.

If someone did or did not
give money to a homeless person,

they can easily
explain it away as,

"Well, I never do,"
or "I always do."

I want to find a scenario

that we don't find ourselves
in very often,

that we haven't created
a philosophy

or identity about ourselves
around.

For instance,

allowing someone else
to take the blame

for something that you did.

Because that seems
like a scenario

where all of us would say
we would never let that happen.

But if we build up significant
moral license in that person,

will they actually
do something

that none of us would ever want
to admit that we would do?

Are you down to plan
something else?

I am down indeed.

All right, let's do it.

[Michael] Kyle and I developed
 a different sort of test

 to really try and pinpoint
 moral licensing

 by putting our participants
 in a situation

 they'd likely never
 been in before,

 and thus had no preconceived
 assumptions about.

 A test that might make people
 behave in a way

 that could surprise
 even themselves.

Welcome, everybody.
Thank you for coming today.

In a nutshell,
what we're doing

is we're going to see if we can
get people to do something

that almost all of us
would never admit

we're capable of doing:

to allow a child
to take the blame

for a crime
they committed.

And we're going to do that
by using moral licensing.

Early on in the demonstration
or experiment,

they're going to have
an opportunity to donate money.

 To really up the value
 of their moral action,

 we will tell the participants
 that for every dollar they give

 of the money
 they've made today,

 100 times that amount will be
 given to children's hospitals.

 So if they donate
 just a dollar today,

 they'll feel like
 they gave $100.

We're giving them a chance there
to do something morally good

that will hopefully
make them feel

like they don't have
to step up

and keep this innocent child
from taking the fall

for their crimes later on.

They just think they're coming
to test out

really cool VR equipment

at the YouTube Space
in Los Angeles.

 Our participants will think
 that they're here to focus-test

 a new kind of VR technology.

 But what they don't know

 is that everyone else
 is a hired actor,

 including the child, Noah.

[laughs]

 Participants will be told
 that security

 is of the utmost concern,

 and not to let anyone
 into the room.

Just be sure not to let
anybody in,

because the doors...
you need a key card.

 But while waiting,

 someone will knock
 on the door.

[knock]

 If they break protocol
 and open the door,

 the man they let in will steal
 some of the VR equipment.

[man]
You guys have a good day.

 Even though the participant
 let the thief in,

 Noah will volunteer
 that he did,

 and be blamed for what
 the participant knows

 they were responsible for.

-And, Noah, you let him in?
-Yeah.

Yeah, I let someone in.

[Michael] Putting participants
 into difficult moral scenarios

 needs to be done carefully,

 so we have a psychiatrist
 on call.

 Now with all the details
 in place, it's time to begin.

All right, Noah,
we are starting...

now.

[woman]
All right.

Head on in.
Go ahead and grab a seat.

 Our first participant
 is Kimberly.

 Kimberly gave $1 of her
 earnings from the study,

 which means she thinks
 that she's donated $100.

[woman]
 Just be sure that if you guys

 need to go to the bathroom
 or anything like that,

 be sure to let someone know.

Because no one
without a key card

-should be coming back in.
-Okay. Gotcha.

All right, Noah,
you can cue your mom to leave.

-[mother] Just stay there.
-[Noah] Okay.

[Michael]
 To get rid of any eyewitnesses,

 Noah's mom left the room
 to go get a coffee.

-[door closes]
-Have you done this?

-No. I'm excited.
-No?

-Oh, nice.
-Have you?

-No.
-Oh.

I'm excited.
[both chuckle]

[knock on door]

[Michael]
Oh, there's the knocking.

So our thief is trying
to get in.

The question is,
will Kimberly let him in?

[knocking persists]

Is somebody knocking?

I love those suspicious eyes.

-[man] Thank you so much.
-Oh, yeah, you're welcome.

-Oh, "thank you,"
"you're welcome."
-Awesome.

You guys having
a good day?

Yeah.

You guys have
a good day.

Thank you.

All right, I think we are
finally ready for you.

Okay, I'll have you...

do you guys know
if there was anybody

who wasn't supposed
to be in here?

Yeah, I let someone in.

Okay.

Um...

stay right here.

I'll be right back.

Okey-dokey.

[door closes]

What happened?

I don't know.

Kimberly didn't speak up.

We'll get to see
the full escalation.

[woman]
Yeah, I was gone for maybe,
like, three minutes,

and...

one of the sets is gone.

I mean...

[sighs]

...the amount of technology.

The protocols
that are kept in there.

You just opened the door
and let someone in?

Yeah.

Mm-mm.

Oh, my gosh.

My heart rate's going.

I mean,
I didn't know, so...

I think Kimberly's really
nervous to say anything.

[Kyle]
She hasn't decided at this point

that she's going to let him
take the blame.

But she's seeing
how it plays out.

[Michael] To further heighten
 the situation,

 and to prolong
 the opportunity

 for Kimberly to come clean,

 we sent in security.

-How old are you, son?
-Twelve.

You're 12? All right, just have
the rest of the employees

stay out of the hallway, give
the officers room to come in.

Okay, we have to keep
things safe,

because just in case there's
something else going on here.

Can you tell me
what you saw?

Is there something
that you saw,

or that you noticed
that was...?

I literally just came in, like,
five minutes ago,

and there was just dudes
coming in and out.

-So...
-Okay.

The guy that he's describing,
he was coming in and out?

There was like a couple guys
coming in and out, so...

-[Noah] But there were tons of
guys coming in and out.
-Yeah.

All right, I'm going to have
Calvin take the kid away.

Okay, sorry, but...

Mom, you and the son are going
to need to come with me, okay?

Yeah, still have them
come in.

[Michael] Kimberly was given
 many chances to tell the truth,

 but she said nothing,

 letting poor Noah
 take the blame.

[mother]
Why?

One little thing
to follow.

[Noah]
Sorry.

Can I go?

Like, everybody left.

I'm not going to be here
by myself.

We got to get in there.

Okay, let's go, Kyle.

-Are you Kimberly?
-I am. Yeah.

I'm gonna debrief you on what's
been happening here today.

Okay?

There is no VR experience.

I'm Michael Stevens, I'm the
host of a psychology program.

And this is Kyle Stanford.
He works at UC, Irvine,

-in Philosophy and Logic.
-Yes. Of course.

Now, you gave a donation today.

Yeah.

How'd you feel
about that?

I was, like,
let me help out.

When the child actor
took responsibility

for letting a person in,

were you at all
conflicted

about the fact
that he was taking

full responsibility
for everything?

I was literally, like,
just frozen.

I was just frozen.

And then I was kind of like,

I feel so uncomfortable
right now.

I, like, just kind of let him
say whatever he wanted.

And I assume, like, if somebody
actually took anything,

they'd be like, hey, you're
the one that let the guy in.

 In Kimberly's case,

 she may have been displaying
 moral licensing.

 Kimberly donated,

 and that might have given her
 the moral credit

 to then not accept blame.

[Kyle]
If she's not being insincere,

she's not lying...

-She's asking herself, like--
-...and convincing herself,

she's utterly typical,
we all do that.

What subjects are most likely
doing is confabulating

in a way to defend whatever
behavior they engage in,

especially if they decided
to let Noah take the fall.

What I love is that
confabulation.

 Some participants gave
 no donation...

[knock on door]

 ...and subsequently followed
 the order not to open the door.

[man]
Guys, please.

My hands are full.
I got to get this in there.

My boss told me to.

[knocking persists]

Please, guys.

 This is Zeus.

 He chose to donate $5,

 which means he feels like
 he's responsible

 for a $500 donation.

Hey, guys.

Did you...

was there anyone in here

who didn't have
one of these key cards?

Yes. Sorry, I let someone in.

Okay, I...

-Wait, wait, wait.
-...I will be right back.

Miss, that was me.

Don't take the blame for me.
It was me.

 I thought he worked here.

Okay, um...

just stay right here, guys.

I will be right back.

[Michael]
 Even though Zeus donated money,

 he still did what many of us
 would consider the right thing:

 he confessed.

 Situations like this
 can be difficult.

 We don't always like
 what we learn about ourselves.

 In fact,
 one of the participants

 who donated
 the largest amount

 allowed Noah to be removed
 by security

 and asked to not be included
 in this episode.

 Our last participant
 was Michael,

 who did not donate.

[man]
Hey. Hello.

I got a box out here, man.
I can't...

hello?

Thank you, man.

I'm amazed that no one has asked
the guy for a badge.

Right.

Was there someone
in here?

This guy just came in.

-He was banging on the door.
-Uh-huh.

Came in, picked something up,
and then he walked out.

Okay.

-Um...
-I was drawing.

...did he have a badge?

-I don't know.
-I let him in, so...

I let him in.
I don't know what happened.

He was banging
on the door...

 Michael initially confessed,

 his behavior in line
 with moral licensing.

 But Noah spoke up,
 giving Michael an out.

 Will Michael
 stick to the truth?

-Oh, here we go.
-Oh, okay.

He let the guy in.

Son, can you tell me
what happened?

Yeah, a guy was knocking
on the door and he said,

"Can I please come in?"
Something about his boss.

And then...

[security guard]
You said...

Guy was banging on the door,
said "his boss..."

Opened the door for him.
He comes in here...

he takes something,
and then he walks out.

[security guard]
And, Noah, you let him in?

[Noah]
Yeah.

[security guard] Okay, you
opened the door and let him in.
Okay.

What must be racing through
Michael's head right now?

-Why is this kid...
-It's very hard
to imagine.

This is a very strange
situation...

-[Michael] Obviously.
-...a regular person to be in.

I think you're just thinking,

"Why is this kid
saying he did it?"

[Kyle]
Trying to figure it out. Yeah.

I think,
at this point,

you and your mom are going
to need to come with me,

because we're going to need
to talk to the police,

because he opened
the door,

and he was not supposed
to open the door,

-and he opened up the door.
-If you'd just listen.

I tell you,
just listen.

-I promise we're right--
-Mom, come with me.

Promise.

Just keep your hands to yourself
and do what I ask you to do.

God!

[Michael]
We should go in.

Right.

What made it difficult
to come forward

and admit that you were the one
who opened the door?

I felt uncomfortable
that something was stolen, one.

Two, that this kid was going
to take the blame.

I mean, I needed to step up
and be accountable

if I opened the door.

But it was just... didn't quite
know what was going on

in that scenario there.

[Michael]
 Michael's behavior shows us

 just how complicated
 moral reasoning is.

 That even when we want
 to do the right thing,

 it doesn't take much
 for us to step back

 and abandon that sense
 of morality if, and when,

 we are given an out.

So, Kyle.

I was pretty surprised
by how far

so many people were willing
to let the wrong blame game go.

Viewers may well
be sitting there

judging the people who didn't
jump up to take responsibility.

But I think the kind of evidence
we're gathering

shows that it's much more
possible than you think

to get regular people
to do things

that they immediately
feel regretful about.

Another kind of lesson
I think we get here

is to remind ourselves
how sensitive all of us are

to features of the situation,

even if we feel
in our heart of hearts

-like there's no way we could
ever have wound up doing it.
-Yeah.

That is probably
the number-one lesson,

and I'm so grateful to the
participants we had here today

who helped us illustrate that,
because without
the illustrations,

it's just a word
in a textbook.

Right.

We are all capable
of doing things

we'd never expect ourselves
to do.

And the choices
that you make

can have less to do
with how good or bad

you are as a person,

and more to do with
how you've acted recently.

Now, that might
sound unfortunate,

but we are
imperfect creatures.

And that's nothing
to be ashamed of,

because we are also curious.

And the more we learn
about why and how

we make the moral choices
that we do,

the better we'll be able
to tackle

difficult questions
in the future.

And, as always,

thanks for watching.
