hey guys Jeff here from ride gamer what

you're about to see is some clips from

the cross-platform comedy stand-up show

we did at comic-con this year I hope you

enjoy I'll leave you with one last

thought back on world of warcraft

because I know you guys love that

clearly this guy does but I was in the

game doing my female Night Out thing and

I should say I don't think I would play

a female Knight up but I like to do the

dance thing and my female fans kind of

like this Oh keep going anyway some dude

I'm standing around I wasn't doing the

dance of time I minded my own damn

business this dude walks up to me it

just goes dude you're so hot what are

you saying that my only response to like

creepy dude right two seconds later he

writes back I'm not creepy where do you

live so I just ignore him for like five

minutes not knowing what to do but he

keeps like messaging me like hey you

want to group up hey need a help what's

going on finally I write back what my

wife always says to me when she wants to

end the like midday I am conversations

we have all right I've got a dick

they usually shut me down

my clothes yeah because I'll be over

here he writes back nice all caps

exclamation exclamation exclamation nice

right it's not like all right dude it's

game on so I know describing what I look

like
