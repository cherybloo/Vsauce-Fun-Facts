Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And today we are going to talk about time, specifically, how

much time we have. What's the oldest a person
can ever be? Well, the world record for the

world's longest living person belongs to Jeanne
Calment, a French woman who lived to be 122.

Right now, at this very moment, there are
only 37 people alive who were born in the

1800's. Those 37 people have lived in three
different centuries. But, as medical knowledge

expands and our understanding of biology improves,
people are living longer, and longer. In fact,

scientists believe that, based on statistics,
the first person who will ever live to be

150 has already been born. It could be one
of you. But, according to the math, it's probably

someone who was born last year.

Here's the thing. As humans get older, the
likelihood of them dying increases, but there

are some types of animals that have what is
called Negligible Senescence, also known as

biological immortality, and these types of
animals have never been observed to actually

age. Animals, like the Hydra, can only die
because of accidents, disease, or predators.

The world's oldest living individual tree
has clocked in at more than 4,600 years old.

It's called the Methuselah Tree and it exists
somewhere in this forest. Government officials

won't actually release its exact location
to protect it from vandalism, but it's out

there.

The lifespan of an organism can be even longer
than that if you include clonal colonies.

For instance, these Quaking Pines all look
like individual trees, but they're actually

all clones of one genetic code. They all share
a root system, and the root system continues

to make more trees, meaning that these trees
are all part of the same organism, and experts

have calculated, based on the roots system,
that this one, male Quaking Pine has been

around for at least 80,000 years.

But let's get back to humans, and rather
than talking about how time is, let's talk about

how time feels. Intense moments of your life
are remembered as lasting much longer than

times that were relatively dull. Psychologists
say that the reason for this is that our brains

take deeper and richer memories of events
that are novel, or events that are intense,

than ones that aren't.

When your experiences are intense and novel,
you're not remembering more things about it,

but you are making more copies. Rather than
just making normal memories, during stress

the amygdala gets involved and also remembers
things, and many people believe that is why

intense moments are remembered as lasting longer.

This phenomenon becomes quite mind-blowing
on a macro-scale. Think of it this way: when

you are a one-year-old baby, one year represents
100 percent of your life, but when your turn

two years old, that second year was only half
your life, and the next year you live through

is only a third of your life, and by the time
you turn 80, one year only represents an 80th

of your life. Those percentages are important
because they may explain why your childhood

feels like it took so long, but as you get
older, the years seem to fly by.

You have more novel experiences when you're
young. You first learn a language, you first

see your mother, you first learn to walk,
you have your first kiss. These are all deeply

and richly remembered by your brain, and so,
later on, it feels as if they took longer

to happen.

Now, here's what's really mind-blowing. Let's
look at a graphical representation of the

percentage of your life that each successive
year is. The first year is 100 percent, the

second year is only half, the third year is
a third, and so-on will go all-the-way out to

80. Now, using this representation, under
this model, when you turn 80 years old and

look back at your life, the point that feels
like the middle isn't your 40's, it's your

early 20's.

The good news here is that the more novel things
you do, and things you see, and places you

visit, and people you meet, the slower time
feels, and the more rich it feels. So, go

out there and do something cool, do something
weird, do something new. Subscribe to Vsauce
