Vsauce, are you leaning back right now?

Of course you're not. But you will be soon,
because a new episode of Vsauce Leanback

has just been released and to start it,
click the link at the top of

this video's description. This week's topic is
really fun. It's a menagerie of awesome

videos from producers

all over YouTube with the atmosphere

of Earth as our rough guide.
We're going to begin way down here,

in this part of the atmosphere, the troposphere,
which is where most weather occurs

and where we live.

And then we'll move up into the
stratosphere and beyond to the

mysterious mesosphere

and then the gigantic thermosphere where
space shuttles roam.

And even though they said it couldn't be done,
we will be discussing the exosphere

today.
So what are you waiting for? Click the link

at the top of this video's description to
begin autoplay mode and let

each video segment start one after the
other. So all you have to do is lean back

and let the information hit you in the face.
I'll see you soon

in the lean back.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
