Hello Vsauce. Michael here,
and I've got a dozen DONGs for you today.

These are things you can do online now,
guys. In the

"I of It" you play not as a super action
hero, but rather

as the actual letter 'I.'
You elongate and

shrink yourself to grab onto ledges and
awkwardly locomote. If you want more

letters,

upgrade your life to the Roman numeral
calculator. For instance,

191 times

7 is 1337. If you brain isn't
challenged, take these quizzes

suggested by "MadebyNotch."
You listen to classic songs from

NES or SNES games and with the help of
hints prove your worth

by identifying them. If tragedy is more
your style, go with "Zombies Took My

Daughter,"

an emotional action game where you have very
little time to find your lost kin

and plenty of zombies to hide from or blow-up.

Too many graphics?
Go textile

with "EauDeParkour's" 'YouFindYourselfInARoom.' Here

you have to type your next move.
What's neat is that the computer receiving your

inputs eventually gets frustrated with you

and things get pretty twisted.
Twist around shapes with Jasmine's mind warping

suggestion.

You use six different keys to rotate
pieces to fit snugly

in all kinds of new ways.
And if you're forever alone,

enjoy the company of Myself, where you solve
puzzles by doing one thing

and then restarting, using the ghost of your
former attempt as a tool.

Now as a bonus, yourself and your ghosts
have different abilities

and it gets pretty satisfying. If you
still don't know how to upside down text,

do like "Nix4222"

and get to ToolsGeek. They'll flip text
that you can copy and paste

anywhere. I've seen a lot of creative
uses of annotation,

but "wtfdany" made one where you can beat him

up.
Just click and boom! Instant results.

Do you like a YouTube video and wish
you could loop it?

Well, "Griever179" showed me that you
can delete 'tube,'

replace it with 'repeat' and be sent to
a site that plays the video

over and over and over again forever.
Control YouTube even more

with the Video Time Machine.
This site's curatorss

verify dates and organize videos. So, say
if I wanted to watch television and

commercials from

the year I was born.
Ta-da! A huge list of

awesomeness to scroll through and
nostalgia about. For 99 cents you can get

the whole time machine as an app on your
iPhone, so it never leaves your side.

I leave you with flip books. 'BloodyRenegadeX' makes stories that will blow

your snot off.

But more personally, Frenzy Woods made a
super cool flip book

of the Vsauce outro. Check his work out,
he sent a lot of great ones.

And hey, what a perfect way to end my
reminder that...

As always,

thanks for watching.
