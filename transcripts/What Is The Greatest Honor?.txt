Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
But where

is here and how much does it weigh?

That's the supposed to be me, huh?
Imitation is a form of flattery.

An honor.
But what is the greatest honor

possible?

Let's begin our journey by looking at
challenges and achievements

worthy of honour.
First, the physical ones.

Being the fastest person to run a marathon

26.2 miles is great but why stop there?

The Iron Man triathlon involves

swimming - 2.4 miles, racing on a bicycle 112 miles

and then running an entire marathon.

Record holder Craig Alexander did it all in

8 hours, 3 minutes and 56 seconds.

Beyond that things begin to get mental.

The self transcendence race held every
summer in New York

is the longest certified foot race

on the planet.
It's not 26 miles long,

it's 3100.

And instead of running thousands of miles
across the varied

landscape of the US, competitors merely run

around the same city block in Queens

5 649 times.

You have 52 days to complete the
race and doing so can

wear out as many as 12 pairs of shoes.

The fastest time for completing the race
goes to Wolfgang Schwerk

who finished in just 41 days,

averaging 75 miles of running

every day.
In the realm of entertainment

there are very clear physical rewards, statuettes like

the Emmy, the Grammy, the Oscar and the Tony.

Winning at least one of each is called an

EGOT. So far 11 humans have won all
four awards in competitive categories.

Marvin Hamlisch and Richard Rodgers
also each won a Pulitzer Prize.

Lynn Redgrave is the only person to have
ever been nominated

for all four awards without winning

a single one.
Some people have won surprising combinations of awards.

Steve Tisch, as chairman and executive
vice president of the New York Giants

and producer of films like Forrest Gump,
American History X

and Snatch is the only person in history
to have won both

a Super Bowl ring and an Oscar.

And throughout all of human history only one person

has won an Oscar and a Nobel Prize.

George Bernard Shaw.
Those are neat facts

but let's define honour. There are two
guys we should go to. The first is Noah

Webster

whose American Dictionary is the reason Americans

spell it honor. The second guy is Samuel
Johnson whose English Dictionary is the

reason people

across the Atlantic, where I usually am, spell it

honour. Johnson differentiated two types
of honored that are relevant to the

question

in this video's title.
The first is what he calls

nobility of soul, magnanimity and the scorn

of meanness. This is honour derived not from
achievement at something competitive

but rather from perceived virtuous conduct

and personal integrity.
But what counts

as a virtue? One of my favorite attempts
to catalog human virtues was done by

Christopher Peterson

and Martin Seligman.
Frustrated by a persistent

focus on mental illness, they devised a guide

to mental wellness.
Their catalog contains 24

virtues and strengths shared across nearly every

human culture.
They attached historical figures

believed to personify each trait and
their list of 24

included fairness, humility,

hope, humor, appreciation,

of beauty and the love of learning.
Using

their list as a scorecard for virtue points to determine

the most honorable person is impossible

but that hasn't stopped people from
discussing the greatest

honor in terms of virtue.
Richard Nixon did some things that people might

consider

dishonorable, but his perspective is illuminating.

In his first inaugural address he said "the greatest

honor history can bestow is the title

of peacemaker."
Peacemaker.

But who has the authority to judge virtue?

Hopefully not individuals.
Richard Wiseman's brilliant

"Quirkology" discusses a survey conducted
in 1997 by US News & World Report,

which asked people who they thought was

somewhat likely to go to heaven

as a marker of perceived virtuous
conduct and personal integrity

it's really illuminating.
52 percent

thought that Bill Clinton would,
60 percent but Princess Diana would

and a full 79 percent said
that they thought Mother Teresa

would go to heaven but she was only second-place.

87 percent of respondents agreed that someone else

was likely to go to heaven.
Who do they think that was?

Themselves.
The greatest honor a country bestows upon those

who have defended, fought for it, often carries the most

awe-inspiring stories.
The greatest military honor in the United Kingdom

is the Victoria Cross.
In the United States

it's the Medal of Honor, given for
conspicuous gallantry

and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond

the call of duty.
Many of its recipients are honored

posthumously.
They are people who acted instantly

and without regard for their own safety

they've walked into enemy fire, loosing their lives

to communicate life-saving messages.
They have fallen on grenades

to absorb the impact with their bodies,

so that others around them wouldn't have to.

Samuel Johnson's second definition of honor

focuses not so much on honor that comes from being

ethically excellent, but instead on honor that comes

from power, from being royal

or famous. Global surveys have shown
that many corporate logos,

like the golden arches, are more famous
than any celebrity

or other symbols.
So, technically speaking, the greatest

honor as far as becoming famous and globally known

might simply be to become a fast food mascot.

Not all honorable people get honored.

How does a grand, recognized public act

made possible by being in the right
place at the right time with the right

opportunities compare to the honor of merely being

the best person you can be?
A good citizen,

a mother, a father, an otherwise

unrecognized person who is nonetheless

an amazing hero to a few.

Your family, your friends, that one person

who really needed you.
Is recognition merely

an accident of luck?
A snowball effect,

an accumulation of advantage.
People who stand out when they are young

are often given access to more opportunities,

which then leads to and entitles them
to more opportunities later on,

accumulating overtime like snow on a
snowball that eventually becomes an

entire boulder of snow

only the original snowball of which
was the original person.

Historians have pointed this phenomenon
out, the accumulation of advantage,

when criticizing the great man theory

of history.
The idea that human history can be talked

or understood as a time line of few

important honored individuals.

Philip Zimbardo, the researcher behind the infamous

Stanford Prison, study has shown that the
wrong situation can bring out

evil in almost anybody.
He stressed in his recent TED talk

that not all of us will encounter just
the right opportunities to become the

next

Gandhi or Neil Armstrong.
But what we can do

is live our lives with what Zimbardo calls

a heroic imagination.
As a hero and waiting,

who thinks sociocentrically, not egocentrically.

He says most heroes are everyday people,

who emerge as heroes in particular situations.

So, a fair argument can be made that simply

knowing you did the right thing when
presented with the situation involving

Peterson

and Seligman's virtues and strengths

is the greatest honour

possible, the most honorable life.

Now, whether or not that honorable
behavior is recognized

Well, Cato the Elder questioned the value imparted by

physical awards by simply saying, "after I'm dead

I'd rather have people ask why I have no monument

than why I have one."
It's an honor to talk to you guys

every week.
So, as always,

thanks for watching.
