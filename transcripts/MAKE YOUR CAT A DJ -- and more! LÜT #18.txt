Bake two pies at the same time and then
relax on

pancake pillows.
It's episode 18

of LÜT.

You can also choose to use emoticon
pillows or a True Blood necklace.

If you're a neat freak, protect your tables
with Portal 2 warning sign coasters.

And then store your photos on an SD card,

or in a SD card photo album.

Personally, I just stick one cool pic on my
laptop lid to make it look see-through

or to make myself look X-rayed or bikini-clad.

And these spatulas will make your cooking more super

hero. Deal yourself hand of nostalgia
with these space invader playing cards

and graduate from Bucky Balls too Bucky

Cubes, a bunch of cube magnets only
outdone by the book

HTML for babies. Teach your child letters
and colours while also reminding them

of proper HTML mark-up.
Vat19's H2O candle kit lets you create

a flame

that appears to sit right on top of water,
which is the best kind of light to play

by when messing around with you Fisher
Price classic toy

keychains.
Thrown on a steampunk skeleton t-shirt

and escape the stress of smartphones 
with John's phone.

It accepts a SIM card, but all it can do

is call people and receive calls.
Due to its simplicity

its call time lasts six hours and when
it's not in use its battery lasts

3 weeks.
I met PureKatherine

in Chicago last month.
Now, she will cover your shoes or

anything else you'd like in glitter,
a perfectly trade secret protected coat of

glitter that doesn't shed

off.
These Batman clothespins also keep things secure

and this skateboard bench is great for
your bedroom.

Here's a robot you can control with an app
on your phone.

Oh look, cats love it.
But if you cat loves scratching,

let him be a DJ and scratch on a
scratching post turntable.

But if your cat dies, that's okay, because
the airport in Amsterdam have trash cans

for your used pets.

Just kidding. PET means polyethylene
terephthalate, a polymer used in liquid

containers.
But, if you're hungry,

check out Exotic Meat Market.
This service sells

legal meat for you to cook and eat.
Raccoon meat,

llama, bacon made from a black bear, crocodile,

kangaroo and even lion meat.

That's right. For $100 you
can buy three burgers

made out of lion meat.
Lions are not endangered

and these burgers are made from lions
raised in Illinois.

The only part that's a little bit weird is
that when you eat lion

you're eating cat.
Okay, now it's time for the free thing.

I'm gonna let you guys in on a little bit of a Vsauce

secret. FakeNameGenerator.com.

This website will give you a person's
name, it'll make up their address, it'll

make up all kinds of data about them every
time you refresh the page,

but what's fun is that it also generates a
pronounceable,

available ".com" domain name.

And it's this service, by sitting there
and pressing refresh over and over again

that

I used to find Vsauce.com.

I said that's the perfect name and hence

here we are today.
Thank you FakeNameGenerator.com

for giving us Vsauce.
And to all of you out there:

As always,

thank you for watching.

Vsauce, welcome to my hotel room.
As you can see, episode 18 of LÜT is back

up. I'm not really sure what happened to it,
I think it may have been the

international police.
They've been after me all weekend

for stealing the hearts of women

all over Madrid. Seriously, I've got like
a dozen of 'em in this bag stuck in the

mini fridge, it's really gross,

but that shouldn't get in the way of
a bonus item I think that I just found last

night.

A terra cotta pot.
Just kidding. It's also a grill

and the grilling surfaces circles mean
that the grill marks on your food

are polka dots.
Pretty fun, right?
