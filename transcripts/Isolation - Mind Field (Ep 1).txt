imagine being confined to a 10 by 10

foot room

in complete isolation no timekeeping

devices no phones no books nothing to

write on no windows

[Music]

psychologists say that fewer than three

days in a room like this can lead to

brain damage I will be staying in this

room for three days

clearly he's on the border of misery

[Music]

even in a city surrounded by people it's

possible to feel lonely or bored your

brain is like a hungry sponge it's

constantly absorbing information it

thrives when stimulated between

smartphones and books and movies and

friends and family thousands of

sensations are constantly going into our

heads but what if it all got cut off

what is boredom well it's believed to be

an emotion that's a less intense form of

disgust a visual representation of

emotions developed by robert plutchik

shows the ball on a wheel notice that

boredom shares a spoke with disgust and

loathing they are different intensities

of the same emotion

you see boredom pushes us away from low

stimulus situations because variety and

stimulation literally lead to

neurogenesis brain cell growth we are

here today doing what we do because

boredom has guided us toward greater and

greater challenges and bigger and more

complex brains so what is it like to be

deprived of the sensations and social

interactions so many of us take for

granted

a landmark study at Harvard and Virginia

universities found that students prefer

to experience physical pain over 15

minutes of boredom to demonstrate the

surprising lengths people will go to to

avoid boredom we brought in an

unsuspecting subject for what he

believes to be a focus group we begin by

introducing a set of stimuli one of

which is very unpleasant Oh dirty what

shocked the out of me our fake

focus test continues so let's start with

the shock button Jamison would you

choose to experience this again I don't

want to do that again why wouldn't you

cuz it shocked me it could still feel it

going down my farm now it's time for

Jameson's true test the test of boredom

you will be in the room for 30 minutes

please remain in your chair

feel free to re-experience the electric

shock button okay or not okay right at

the moment of truth when the only two

options are boredom or painful shock

which will our subject choose he's not

even looking at the button

it hasn't even been a minute yet and

already Jamison is Restless with nearly

a half hour to go and no other

stimulation in the room the shock button

is a tempting object to occupy Jameson's

mind

remember what Jamison said a few minutes

ago I don't want to do that again but

will he desire stimulation so strongly

he just goes ahead and pushes that

button

[Music]

it took exactly one minute and 57

seconds of boredom for Jameson's mind to

go from never again to sure I'll give

myself an electric shock to relieve

boredom sometimes stimulation any

stimulation is perceived as better than

none at all now this guy doesn't like

being bored but can he resist touching

it a second time

[Music]

we're social animals whether it's

another human or a volleyball or an

electric shock button you'll make

friends with whatever you need to

Jameson I'm Michael thanks for coming in

today so tell me a little bit about what

you've been up to here in this room I've

been sitting in this room with a button

yeah and despite saying I didn't want to

press it again I pressed it twice why I

just bored in this room I suppose really

yeah

did that hurt yes the hypothesis is that

when left alone with a very negative

stimulus people will go ahead and

re-experience it just because it's

something to do

[Music]

we dislike being bored so much sometimes

physical pain is preferable but

intentionally putting yourself into what

would seem to be the most boring

environment possible can be useful it's

called sensory deprivation psychologists

have conducted experiments on sensory

deprivation since the 1930s during the

Cold War the military used sensory

deprivation for both training and

interrogation in the 1970s the activity

became recreational with soundproof

light proof floatation tanks that keep

you buoyant with salt water that is the

same temperature as your body

all right so I'm on my way to a

subterranean float lab this company

sells sensory-deprivation this will be a

sort of training session for my three

days in isolation and I'm getting

guidance from an expert

hey Dominic how are you hey what's up

Michael you know Dominic Monaghan from

Lord of the Rings and the TV series lost

now this is your first time this is my

first time I'm a little nervous I've

never been alone without any stimulation

one of my favorite things about flowing

is there's nothing else going on okay I

can't see anything you can't hear

anything you can't do anything you just

have to look at you and for some people

that's scared it's like looking in a

mirror if you out this notation tank is

a really good way of getting in prepped

for the isolation chamber but I also

think he needs to be okay with the fact

that it's gonna put mass out of his

comfort zone

the mind is a good thing to lose every

so often all right let's take a peek oh

so this is the room this is where I will

be floating for the next hour alone with

nothing to do but listen to my thoughts

I'll see you on the other side

the mind is a good thing to lose every

so often you have to remind fear that

you're in the drivers drivers drivers

drivers hey Dominic pause it it was

really good yeah can we sit down let's

do it

my initial my initial thought my when I

lay down was wow this is buoyant and

then I just started thinking about

errands and tasks but at some point well

it was like dreams huh but my eyes were

open like those sort of like half dreams

you have either when you're about to

fall asleep or when you're waking out

that's when it gets interested you're

allowing your brain to be free you're

just floating in space you're just

actives that are on the top of this pool

floating in space

so now you've done this and you do this

this isolation booth delia that was in

some way helpful or hindrance it made me

more unhappy about what's coming up

three days is quite a bit different than

one hour

some people choose isolation to learn

about isolation as we prepare to explore

other planets were faced with a little

issue stuff in outer space is really

really far apart within our own solar

system

even a trip to Mars would take months in

each direction that's a long time to

spend cut off from the rest of humanity

stuck at a tiny spaceship to get ready

for those journeys we have subjected

some people to extreme conditions here

on earth in 1989 a young Italian

interior designer named Stefania Fellini

volunteered for a NASA experiment to

help study the effects of isolation

associated with space travel she spent a

hundred and thirty days alone in a

plexiglass cell in a cave 30 feet

underground in New Mexico in the absence

of timepieces and any sign of day or

night miss Fellini's body was thrown out

of whack her menstrual cycle stopped and

her sleep-wake cycle changed radically

she tended to stay awake for 20 to 25

hours at a time sleeping about 10 hours

when she finally emerged she mistakenly

believed she'd only been underground

about half as long as she actually had

as difficult as Stefani's experience was

at least she had books to read in my

isolation chamber I will only have white

walls to stare at

alone time what a pleasure

checking out getting away from it all

relaxing banishment from society the

silent treatment solitary confinement

solitude isn't always nice what happens

when isolation is not voluntary William

Brown has first-hand knowledge of

solitary confinement

so William how how much of your life

have you spent in prison probably like

16 years it's like almost half your life

yeah basically almost half my life

because I went to jail when I was 18 on

bank robbery this right here this is my

home off enough about two years though

was the longest stretch of consecutive

time I was like five months total I'll

tell you what really amazes me this

feels so much worse than a jail cell

this doesn't have bars letting in light

or a view not at all would you have a

mattress at least that would be the only

thing in this particular cell that would

be the only thing in here you would you

would just have a mattress and that you

would have nothing more this light will

constantly stay on so there would be you

know it's always on that light is always

been at night even at night that light

is always on your left in here with your

thoughts that's it

I would sit like like say friends I will

sit in this corner right here like based

in the corner facing out no I won't face

out and I will just sit and just

concentrate on breathing you don't know

it's like you're in the limbo hey you

never know when I got over the door I've

known guys that have served consecutive

years inside this same little box how

does that change them mentally it's cars

them for life really yeah this is what

I'm gonna do I'm gonna put myself in a

room like one of these and I won't have

a clock anything at all no way to tell

time what I'm nervous about is when that

door closes and the awareness the sudden

awareness of how much time I have

see that's the thing about it cuz once

this door right here closes it's like

it's it's final this is almost a coffin

really

even more extreme than isolation from

other people is isolation from other

people and stimuli that's what I'm going

to be doing inside this room this is

about as boring as a room can get it's

soundproof and this light will never

turn off I do have a small bed but there

will be no interruptions I will have no

way to tell what time it is no meals

will be delivered because all the meals

are inside the room already white

containers of Soylent I do have plenty

of water and I have a wash basin with a

white bar of soap and I've got myself a

tiny little toilet there's nothing to do

but be completely alone with myself and

my thoughts now psychologists say that

fewer than three days in a room like

this can lead to brain damage I will be

staying in this room for three days a

full 72 hours

so I'm gonna take your vitals first

Michael is basically turning himself

into a lab rat what we want to do is see

what might change with Michael before

and after his time in isolation what's

gonna happen to his blood pressure

what's gonna happen to his pulse his

basic reflexes are there actually any

medical concerns you would have I'm just

gonna be in this room you got a really

bright light on there the circadian

rhythm which is your natural wake and

sleep cycle is going to be completely

disrupted by this really bright light

and once your circadian rhythm gets off

a lot of other things fall apart hormone

cycles

cognitive ability metabolic processes so

you know it's kind of like you're giving

yourself jetlag how great I think it's

important to test his cognitive ability

to gauge any mental decline that might

happen during at 72 hours of isolation

let's try the reaction time okay dude

this is pretty fun can I bring this into

the room with me so what's gonna happen

to my brain in there well one of the

issues that might worry me is how calm

versus neurotic you might be where would

you put yourself on that spectrum closer

to neurotic coming on yeah so I wonder

if that might be amplified that is how

my brain will work it'll snowball

I'm scared I'm not gonna be able to deal

with the monotony and the lack of a

sense of time and I'm gonna have a panic

attack in an extreme situation people

can have massive hallucinations

disassociated from reality have

tremendous anxiety psychotic types of

episodes Marty Jake yes I'm gonna be

gone for three days the danger signs to

look out for are extreme agitation where

it doesn't appear that he's aware of his

own agitation that's when I think I

might intervene I'm not worried for him

physically like I think he's you know

he's safe in there but I think that he's

gonna struggle in there he's gonna be

really bored

love you bye-bye

[Music]

by

forgot to ask what time it was when I

came in

she's always doing something reading

something talking to someone the or day

looks really bored in this making their

five offenders it's just gonna be a

horrible 72 hours I'm actually pretty

tired I've been standing a bunch today

normally when I change into more

comfortable clothes and I'm like ready

for bed I lay down and then I pick up my

phone or a pick up a book or something

but I don't even I don't have that if he

succeeds in going to sleep for any

length of time that's substantial that's

gonna be interesting to see it what time

he thinks it is when he wakes up right

I was able to sleep and I woke up maybe

one or two times in the night so I think

it's probably you know 8 a.m. Thursday

morning maybe closer to 9 a.m. I guess I

should have some breakfast

one two three

I've known Michael for three years and

I've never seen him do a push-up zy x w

vu t sr q p o n MLK I think he's come up

with some some good ideas for mental

stimulation I wonder if it's time goes

by he's gonna come up with some more

creative ones or he's gonna start to get

less creative I've done 200 steps now

eight more hundreds to go and I'll be at

a thousand why is it that so many people

turn to counting to stay saying when

they're in these isolated environments

well our our minds want to remain active

there they're naturally active the

healthiest people who survive in these

types of environments will do something

to self stimulate they'll count they'll

sing they'll do physical exercise one

hundred three hundred steps and then

some change that I just took right there

that's just a little bonus for my body

for my health

it's amazing how hard it is to tell what

time of day it is just based on your

body I think it's about 7:00 or 7:30

p.m. on Thursday I think I'm gonna have

dinner now he's already quite off on his

perception of time I was actually

surprised at how quick that happened I

was too you know if you're using hunger

as your gauge that's out the window too

because the shifts and hormones are

going to change your appetite now they

look at lab rats who have had their

circadian rhythm destroyed and they

overeat

13 at the moment I'm feeling bored but

obviously nothing dramatic if I had to

guess it would be 24 hours now since I

first came in one day down two to go

if he gets a full sleep cycle in he'll

wake up not knowing where he is

right good morning I don't know if I

slept for eight hours or if I slept for

three if you think it's bedtime it is so

long as you go to bed if you think it's

breakfast time it is if you're having

breakfast what am I looking forward to

the most

seeing my my family and friends it's not

even that I want a meal it's actually

that I just want to have a meal with

people I just want to talk to some

people I just want some other words

coming in to me than the ones that come

out of my own mouth he enjoys sharing

things with people and to have no one

there's nothing coming back for three

days might be difficult I am the only

person I'm hanging out with if you're in

true isolation literally part of your

brain is generating some kind of

companion converse with I think having

you here makes a big difference

you know he's entertained himself in a

sense you know talking to the camera and

that's been helpful for him it's really

kept him cognitively aware I just feel

like I've really lost all connection to

time but I'm guessing it's you know 8

p.m. maybe 9 p.m. on Friday a good time

to get some some shut-eye when there's

not much else to do

[Music]

I think it's Saturday about 9:00 a.m.

Saturday the day I get out so his

dissociation with the actual time has

doubled now right he wakes up and

there's this bright light and he's

thinking oh it must be morning I've

spent a lot of time to being entertained

by my memories and I'm thinking of the

people and the places and the events and

how I missed them and how I treasure

those moments there's a sort of cinema

in my brain a cinema of those memories

that's kept me from being very bored so

I think it's 8 p.m. on Saturday so in

about a couple hours I should see that

door open he's not even close and I

wonder how he's gonna respond to that

[Music]

I don't think I'm getting out today a

fear I have right now is that it's just

Friday and if there's still a lot of

time left there are other times during

this that I was definitely more Zen

about everything now I'm upset I can't

believe the color of the light isn't

changing in the mornings when I wake up

it's so much more yellow without some

type of stimulation the mind wants to

stimulate itself anyway and will begin

to hallucinate and begin to play all

sorts of tricks absolutely

my thoughts are really incoherent there

it's hard for me to even to remember

what I just thought in 712 713 714 715 7

fifteen 716 717 70 in a way our brains

are kind of uh use it or lose it thing

he's going to have a definite decrease

in his cognitive ability a decrease in

his overall sense of well-being

how many bottles of water if I drink is

there one more

laying around here that I've lost

because there are only six here but then

down here there are did I

[Music]

all of the dreams I've had that I

remember have been about this room

they've been about me being in this room

and about

he wakes up in these in the room it's

difficult for him to discern the

difference between reality and dreaming

sometimes so that's a real dissociation

for him sr q LMNOP worried about him now

because when he first went in there he

was like bored like someone waiting for

a bus you know now he looks actually

depressed the soap is really unique it's

not a kind of soap I've ever used before

and I really dislike the smell and I

keep smelling it because it's just

sitting there clearly Michael is not

happy right now he he looks like you

know on the border of misery really

aggravated by how uncomfortable I am

this seems like a very very long three

days

[Music]

he was just laying there when I walked

in I thought he'd be you know city like

bed you know this was something he

wanted to do but I expected him to be

bored terribly bored but I thought he'd

still be talking and trying to entertain

himself

[Music]

it seems like Michael woke up from some

kind of dream he looks confused

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I'm really confused

we did I guess not I guess I just dreamt

it I am so confused

[Music]

is 72 hours over it's 72 hours Michael

you can come out all right I'm coming

out oh my gosh it's bright in there it's

really bright in there I hadn't really

noticed but now that you mention it

we're outdoors hey that knock scared me

did it startle you yeah every little

noise has been startling me okay you

seem very with it right now it's excited

energy yeah

like coming out at first I thought it

was that I want to communicate but

actually I need this direction too even

if it's just nods and stuff that's so

much better

let me just check your vitals before you

see your family 155 over 95 so that's

quite a jump in your blood pressure

[Music]

your pulse is also higher I think that's

because you're excited to be out I think

this is a huge rush I'm interested to

see now how you do with some of the more

cognitive tests three 18:09 seven -

seven - there you go I would say you did

actually a little bit better this time

oh wow

okay although we had AI pathi sized you

would be worse at all of these tests

I think the rush of adrenaline that you

got from finally being out and being

able to communicate actually had you

more focused more aware and that's why

you performed better I find it

interesting that the tests you did the

worst on is probably the most to do with

the use of the verbal language and

you've had definitely a lack of that

over the last 72 hours it was just me

with myself for three days it was only

me how are you oh good I missed you let

me say hi to my mom Oh glad you served

right yes in the room I was fine being

alone this is what I've been living but

then near the end as I started to

anticipate coming out and and being able

to talk to people and share my

experience I realized how important that

was if you only have your own

experiences you're not fully having them

you have to have someone else to listen

to them and react to them and then

you've fully experienced them anyway I

I've moved I don't live there anymore

when I was in isolation I was surprised

most by two things how easy it was to be

separated from distractions like

entertainment and phones and how

difficult it was to be separated from

things we humans evolved alongside the

earth and other people I was amazed by

how uncomfortable confusing and scary it

was to have nothing but myself you know

I used to be a really big fan of the

Seine he who travels fastest travels

alone I think I liked it because it made

me feel better about how I preferred to

be independent and to be left to my own

devices but now I appreciate the full

phrase better it may be true that he who

travels fastest travels alone but he who

travels furthest travels with others and

as always thanks for watching
