Michael here and here I am the real

Michael this Michael was created by a

brilliant young man named Mitchell who

brought it to me at a meet and greet

after brain candy live it is phenomenal

and obviously the most handsome

Jack-in-the-Box ever

EST is a mountain that's 8.848

kilometers tall its size is impressive

or is it

let's cut Earth the entire planet right

in half straight through Everest and

then start zooming out as you can see

Everest's monumentality quickly

disappears against Earth's planetary

gynormosity

compared to Earth's diameter Everest in

fact in fact all of Earth's ruggedness

barely registers now that can seem

surprising since we're often surrounded

by diagrams and maps and globes that

exaggerate Earth's topography now

there's a good reason to do that but it

leads to a misconception about just how

smooth Earth is here's a typical example

a cross-section of the United States

that I found on Reddit the vertical axis

spans about ten thousand feet but the

horizontal axis represents nearly 14

million so stretched to the same scale

so as to mirror reality the actual

smoothness of the earth becomes apparent

on this one foot diameter Globe Everest

is a bump about two millimeters High

feels good but if the Earth was actually

this small Everest would be a bump only

a fifth of a millimeter high it's ten

times taller than it should be

only 24 people have seen the Earth with

their own eyes as a circle small enough

to be looked right at not as the whole

world but as a little thing suspended

alone in space

further away you are from a ball the

more of its surface you can see now we

don't always notice this because in our

day-to-day lives most of the balls we

deal with are so small they're almost

always many of their own radii away from

us and the available amount of their

surface visible is near a maximum or

they're so big like the Earth that we

rarely get far enough away fast enough

to notice this property but the next

time you're near a ball get close to it

you'll see that as you get nearer more

of its surface disappears behind the

Horizon but moving back up will make it

available again for most of us stuck our

whole lives on Earth's surface such an

experience is impossible with nothing

around to block your review five

kilometers about three miles is about

the furthest you can see now Haze can

limit your view and Atmospheric

refraction can slightly extend it but

for the most part everything you can see

happens within an area of just 80 square

kilometers that's not bad but it's tiny

compared with what there is to see the

higher up you go of course the further

away you'll be able to see that's why

it's great to be a satellite here's the

International Space Station yeah look at

that nice big portion of the surface in

view

unfortunately this isn't a scale if the

Earth were the size of an apple how far

away would the International Space

Station orbit like this far away

maybe this far away or maybe this far

away

actually it orbits

here 2.7 millimeters above the surface

that's how far the stem of this apple

sticks up that's not very far oh here's

another fun little two scale fact if the

Earth were the size of an apple your

eyeball would be about the size of the

Moon

we often imagine that from the

International Space Station astronauts

see the Earth like this but they're just

not that far away from where they

actually orbit International Space

Station residents only see about three

percent of Earth's surface at any one

time and that three percent is too wide

to all fit within a window when I was in

Pittsburgh their Science Museum had a

mock-up of part of the ISS and as you

can see out of the window Earth is still

quite expansive using special lenses

images can be taken from the ISS that

look like circular disc Earths But the

lens is distorting things here it's

fitting much more into the picture in

order to truly witness Earth's entire

shape with your own eyes you would need

to either smash your face right up

against a window or just be floating

outside the station and even then you

would have to move your head to Sea from

edge to edge

so how high up do you have to go to see

the edges of Earth all at once and even

if you did that

how much would you actually see

how much is there to see

earth is made of stuff

lots of stuff water and dirt and rocks

and air all of which are composed of

atoms tiny things so teeny that a single

drop of water contains not a million

atoms not a billion atoms or a trillion

or a quadrillion or a quintillion but

five

sextillion atoms earth is made of even

more stuff not a septillion atoms not an

octillion non-alien decillion undicilian

duodacillian treticilian not even a

quatero decillion but 100 Quin decillion

atoms

but since we live only on the surface of

our planet we unfortunately can't see

most of those atoms if the Earth was

shaped like a disc or an icosahedron or

say a cube or a rectangular prism or two

stellated rhombic dodecahedrins we could

see more of the earth than we normally

can but as things are we actually see

nearly the least of Earth's matter

possible because of all solids a sphere

which the Earth approximately is has the

smallest surface area to volume ratio

the most stuff inside and the least

stuff outside so how many of these 10 to

the 50 atoms that make up Earth are on

the surface for us to see that's not an

easy question for one thing technically

atoms on the surfaces of opaque things

like rocks and dirt aren't the only

Parts involved in their appearances

subsurface scattering can and does

happen regardless attempting even a

rough approximation is Illuminating I

asked Grant from the YouTube channel

three blue one brown for some help and

he pointed out that if you calculate the

number of circles with atom-sized radii

that could pack optimally cover a sphere

with the surface area of Earth you get

about 1.5 times 10 to to the 34th

that's a lot of atoms but then he

pointed out that the Earth's surface

isn't smooth its roughness provides

extra surface area for atoms to occupy

without a complete description of the

shape of Earth's surface Every Mountain

and Valley every bump on every rock this

is just going to be hopeless right

no here's the thing

that from far away make big rugged

shapes in other words Earth's surface

can be described as a fractal there is a

regularity to its roughness in fact

mathematicians have even assigned a

fractal Dimension to Earth's surface

2.3

now to see what that means I highly

recommend Grant's video on fractal

Dimensions it's fascinating using 2.3

and assuming that it applies from the

scale of a human hair up to that of a

mountain Grant found that the number of

atoms on Earth's surface changes

significantly up from a power of 34 to a

power of 37. that's a thousand times

more atoms so maybe we shouldn't count

Earth's roughness out just yet it's

smooth

but not perfectly to put that number in

perspective the human body contains

about 10 to the 27 atoms that's 10

powers of 10 less than the surface of

the Earth

10 powers of 10 is 10 billion there are

about seven and a half billion humans so

more or less it can be said that there

are the same number of atoms

in every human body right now as there

are on the surface of the Earth

as I've shown before all human bodies

piled into one place would barely even

fill the Grand Canyon but all human

atoms spread across the Earth would

almost perfectly cover it just one atom

deep

fun fact the mass of the atmosphere is

about 2.5 percent less than what you

would get by multiplying sea level

pressure 14.7 pounds per square inch by

the surface area of the Earth because

Earth's terrain displaces about that

much air

earth's surface is pretty cool obviously

I mean it's got lichen and monster

trucks and an island in a lake

on an island in a lake on an island but

from down here on its surface we just

can't see that much of it your view of

Earth is obstructed by lots of opaque

things walls buildings trees rocks

terrain if Earth was flat you could see

further

but sorry it's a rough world out there

or is it if you could hold the Earth in

your hands like this how bumpy would it

actually feel we already saw that even

our planet's biggest bumps barely

register relative to Earth's size but

let's go somewhere famously flat where

relative to our size terrain rarely gets

in the way of seeing lots of the planet

the U.S state of Kansas I grew up here

and took this footage while driving

across the state last year

you can probably see why Kansas is often

called flatter than a pancake however

although it is famously flat Kansas is

not the flattest U.S state in a

fantastic piece of research Jerome

Dobson and Joshua Campbell defined looks

flat like this if from a given point any

part of the terrain within the Horizon

Rises more than 0.32 degrees up about

the height of a 30 meter Hill at the

Horizon a typical person would say well

hey that part's not flat by cleverly

applying this rule to topographical data

they were able to give every state a

flatness score

West Virginia was the least flat Kansas

was only the seventh flattest Delaware

Minnesota Louisiana North Dakota and

Illinois are all by this method flatter

than Kansas as was the number one

flattest state

Florida

Adam Savage and I had the pleasure of

visiting Florida with our brain candy

live show this year and as this footage

from Atop The King Center in Melbourne

Florida shows it's pretty gosh dang flat

now even though Kansas is not the

flattest it is the state most often

ranked flattest when the general

population is asked it is truly

scientifically flatter than a pancake

it's been demonstrated but there's more

to the story than that in 2003

researchers took a 130 millimeter wide

pancake procured from IHOP and analyzed

its local reliefs they found the

difference between high and low points

was on the order of about two

millimeters if a typical pancake like

this was the size of Kansas 5 million

times larger two millimeter high peaks

would be 10 kilometer high mountains in

comparison Mount Everest is only about

8.8 kilometers tall and Earth's deepest

Scar the Marianas Trench is thought to

be just under 11 kilometers deep

so not only is Kansas about as smooth as

a pancake but so is every other state in

the Union and so is the entire world

if you were a giant holding the planet

in your hands like this you and it would

be torn apart by the immense title

forces created by your gravities if

somehow you could avoid that though the

planet would feel not much rougher than

running your hands over a pancake

but a soggy one right I mean most of

Earth's surface is covered in water your

hands would get wet

or would they

yes Earth is covered in liquid but the

depth of that liquid like the mountains

above just doesn't compare to the total

size of the planet as it turns out if

the Earth was the size of a typical

classroom Globe like this one one foot

in diameter the volume of water

contained in above and on it would only

be about 14 milliliters that's this much

water

it's kind of hard to believe because at

this scale spreading this much water

across all of the ocean's surfaces would

be pretty much impossible due to surface

tension but this is it

all of Earth's water compared to all of

Earth ninety percent of the space on our

planet life can live in is in here the

other 10 percent is dry land so no you

wouldn't get wrinkly fingers playing

with an earth like this you could stop

it dry just with a paper towel despite

the incredible area oceans cover on our

planet their depth is just nothing

compared to the size of our entire

planet

now you may have heard it said that if

the entire planet were shrunk down to

the size of a billiard ball it would be

smoother than a billiard ball after all

we've seen so far that seems believable

but as it turns out it's not true the

misconception stems from the

interpretation of the world pool

billiard association's rules now

according to them a ball must have a

diameter of 2.25 inches plus or minus

five thousandths of an inch now some

Riders have taken this to mean that pits

and bumps of five thousandths of an inch

are allowed proportionately on Earth

that would mean a mountain that was 28

kilometers high so since Earth has none

of those Earth must be smoother than a

billiard ball except if bumps that high

were actually allowed on a pool ball a

ball covered with 120 grit sandpaper

would be within regulation clearly the

five thousandths rule is more about

roundness deviation from a sphere and

not texture in fact as microscopic

photography has shown imperfections on

regulation balls are only one 100

000 of an inch or about half a

micrometer deep and high scale down to

the size of a billiard ball Earth's

marionist trench would be 49 micrometers

deep so Earth is smoother than a pancake

but not smoother than a billiard ball

nor as XKCD wonderfully showed is Earth

smoother than a bowling ball but hold on

earlier we were using the word flat now

we're using the word smooth

that distinction is important you see

the Earth isn't flat like a plane

instead

it curves it's a ball

pieces of earth like Kansas might be

quite smooth but they curve along with

Earth if you were to stand in the middle

of Kansas people on the Eastern or

Western edges of the state would appear

to be not level with you but about 8.1

kilometers below you that's nearly the

height of Everest and if they stood

straight up they'd be tilted nearly two

degrees relative to where you thought up

was now here's an interesting

coincidence generally speaking one mile

from where you are Earth curves down

about eight inches one kilometer from

where you stand it curves down about

eight centimeters now the rate of drop

due to curvature isn't a linear one you

can't just multiply any Distance by

eight to get the drop due to curvature

instead use an online calculator like

the one I've linked down in this video's

description you can put in any distance

you want

anyway the visibility limit caused by

Earth's curvature is your horizon it

encircles you like a visual cage but

it's a cage whose radius is determined

by how high up your eyes are Conan

O'Brien at six foot four inches tall can

see up to five kilometers in any

direction but Snooki at four foot eight

can only see about 4.3

to find out how far away your horizon is

geometrically just use the online tools

I've put down in the description below

Earth's texture can get in the way of

your horizon but can also cause things

Beyond the Horizon to peek into view hey

what's that.com factors all of this in

now if Earth was a smooth sphere the

view from atop Ben Nevis the highest

mountain in the British Isles would end

at the Horizon

131 kilometers away about 80 miles such

an area would look like this but

factoring in Earth's ups and downs

here's a more precise boundary of what

you can see lot tregg Scottish Gaelic

for Lake of death is only about 10 miles

from the peak that's within an 80 mile

radius but it can't be seen because

Terrain in the way blocks it parts of

the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea

eight times further away can be seen

they lie at the limit of Earth's

curvature just before it bends the

surface out of sight

these spikes extending beyond the

geometric Horizon are caused by things

Beyond it that are tall enough to Peak

above Earth's curvature in the case of

Ben Nevis this includes high elevation

parts of Northern Ireland okay enough

about the surface and what it's like

close up let's go further away and see

more this will be fun but there will be

a trade-off the further away you are

from something the smaller it will

appear to be moving away from Earth will

make more area available to sea but that

area will take up less of your field of

view it can be difficult to illustrate

this in a YouTube video because your

field of view the shape and size of what

you can see with your head still just by

moving your eyes around is about 120

degrees up and down and more than 180

degrees horizontal a screen is just a

window of that space nowhere close to

filling it unless you get uncomfortably

close to help us visualize large

apparent sizes let's replace the

spherical Earth with a flat disc that's

always the same distance from The

Observer this disc can be given an

apparent size equal to Earth's from any

altitude and the disc can contain on it

everything that would fit within your

horizons from any altitude

okay so standing on the surface looking

straight down Earth will take up nearly

a full 180 degrees of your field of view

with your arms extended straight out

parallel to Earth your fingers will

point to the edges of the planet Your

Horizon from 400 kilometers up about

where the ISS orbits three percent of

the earth's surface is within your

horizon but the Earth will only take up

about 140 degrees of your vision your

fingers would point to Earth's edges if

you narrowed your arms angles each by

the width of two outstretched fists one

fist is about 10 degrees across at arm's

length now you can move your eyes from

edge to edge horizontally here but you

can't quite take in the full width

vertically but for more than twice this

altitude 1 000 kilometers away Earth is

only 120 degrees across that's one less

fist width each this is perfect that

fits within our narrower vertical field

of view so from a thousand kilometers up

about 620 miles you can just start to

see Earth as a complete disk right in

front of you at once however only seven

percent of Earth fits within the Horizon

from up here

's a birth taken by satellites this far

up like the tsunami NPP look kind of

weird I mean North America doesn't

actually take up this much of the globe

Earth's 120 degree width has been

compressed to fit in an image much

narrower compare Africa from its height

to the famous Blue Marble picture taken

from 45

000 kilometers away the latter looks

more realistic like looking at a globe

on your desk

geosynchronous satellites are about 35

000 kilometers high from their altitude

43.4 percent nearly a whole half of

earth's surface is visible but the Earth

only takes up a meager 17 degrees you

could completely cover it with two

outstretched Palms

that's incredible but what about from

the Moon well from that far away Earth

is only about two degrees across you

could block it out with your

outstretched thumb however you can see

more of Earth you can see further around

its curvature from the Moon

49 of earth's surface is visible

just 49. if you want to see 50 half of

Earth's surface at once you have to go

even further away in fact you have to go

infinitely far away

which you can't the most of a sphere you

can see at once with your own eyes is

just half

but in the real world way before you

were actually infinitely far away the

amount of light reaching you from

Earth's surface would become so small

and infrequent that you wouldn't be able

to see anything at all

stars like our sun are much brighter and

bigger than the earth but only a handful

have even with our best technology been

resolved as anything larger than just a

single point from one thousandth of a

light year away our own Sun would look

like every other star in the sky a

single point to the naked eye only about

as wide as R doradis the widest star in

our sky from 91 light years away

the point of our son would dim to a

level undetectable by the naked eye

it would disappear

most of the stars in the night sky you

can see with your naked eye are further

away than that we can see them though

because they're brighter and bigger than

our own sun which means if there's life

out there living in systems around the

Stars we've marveled at and written

stories about since Humanity began

chances are we are not part of their

constellations or folklore

we're a dark patch in the sky to them an

ignorable emptiness framing other stars

the ones they Marvel at

while not knowing we're here or that

there's anything here

and as always

alzheimer's research I'm incredibly

proud of it but what's going on on this

shirt well it's modular multiplication

around a circle we have the numbers 1 to

40 around the outside of a circle

connected to their product with the

number four so one is connected to four

two is connected to eight three is

connected to twelve and so on even past

40 you can keep Imagining the numbers

continuing for instance one can become

41 2 can become 42 and this emerges the

Vsauce V many other shapes can be made

by using different multipliers or

different numbers around the circle
