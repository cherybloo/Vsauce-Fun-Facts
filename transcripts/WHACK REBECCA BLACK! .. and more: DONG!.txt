Vsauce. Today on my subway ride into work I

earned the very final star I needed in
Angry Birds.

But I know what you're thinking.
"Michael, I don't care. I want things I can do

online now, gosh!"
DONG. Let's begin

with Leanback. That's right, there's a
brand new episode of Vsauce Leanback

out today.
It's a television-length playlist

full of - this week - optical illusions.
You can start it by clicking the link

at the very top of this video's description.
'Idotidot2' pointed me to How Many

Of Me, where you can type in your name and find
out how many people in the US

have your same name. Now, if you wanna two games at
once, be like 'tjockislol'

and become Mario until you press the
spacebar and begin

Tetris to strategically help Mario.

Want more pep? Well, be like 'DEEMEMH' and use GoBarbra.com

to make Duck Sauce's song about whatever you want. For instance:

"I'm watching DONG."

Too fast? Slow down with 'Erinbunny1's' reminder
of this oldie

in B-flat. Every embedded video is in the
same key,

so you can pick and choose which ones to
bring in

and when. 'Yorkerbird434' turns up the
violence with a Whack Rebecca Black game

built like YouTube.

Throw her for points and if you kinda feel bad or

weird, don't work. 'MochaholicPuppy' thinks you're a licensed toy

and animal psychologist. This site let's you
evaluate toys and even administer

drugs.

Last week I showed off a game that let's
you compose music with dots

and 'sofusser' created an entire Vsauce symphony.

'Sofusser' also made some pretty sweet
designs on World of Text, so

check them out.

Last week I also talked about some work
from Mister

Doob. 'Gaigaigoo' said whoa, whoa, whoa,
there's more Stevens.

And there is. Mr. Doob has made a lot
of awesome things, like this page you can

drag images into

right from your computer and then watch them warp and twist.

Click to cause a whole new
transformation. He also built a sweet

browser-based fullscreen cloud simulator

you can fly through by moving your
cursor around.

But what your browser really needs is
balls and he brought those too.

This site of his gives you balls you can pick
up and throw, but you can also grab the actual

browser window

and give it a shake.

I leave you with something very special.

This link will take you to a video
were you can listen to what's known as

the IMG

montage music in its entirety. You now
have the power to make anything in your

life

an instant IMG montage. Of course what you
really want to do

is watch today's new episode of Vsauce Leanback all

about optical illusions sourced from all
over YouTube.

It's a really cool collection and I'm having a lot of fun making them, so check it out.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
