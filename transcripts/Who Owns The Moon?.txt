Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Gregory W. Nemitz

registered some land containing 492

quintillion dollars worth of platinum.

The land was right here... well,

over here - an asteroid

named 433 Eros.
Not a single sovereign nation on earth

recognizes human claims to
extraterrestrial real estate,

but he did it anyway.
And then, less than a year later,

NASA landed a probe on the asteroid.

They called it the first asteroid
we had ever landed a probe on.

Nemitz called it "parking space number 29"
and promptly sent

NASA a 20 dollar parking ticket.
But so far,

NASA and the US Attorney General 
have dismissed the fine, saying that

his claim to own the asteroid is without legal merit.

But why?

Plenty of organizations exists that will
gladly take your money in return for

land on the Moon, Venus, Mars.
And if you had enough money to go to the Moon,

nothing is legally stopping you from moving there,

building a house with a significant
other, having some kids and turning

your Moon house

into a Moon home.
It wouldn't be trespassing

or squatting or stealing.
The 1979 Moon Treaty

says that no one can own any part of outer space

ever, but only 11 states have signed it.
However,

129 nations have signed and/or ratified the 1967

Outer Space Treaty, which says that outer
space is not subject to national

appropriation.
It says nothing about a private individual

or a company owning part of outer space.

But without the recognition and support
of at least one sovereign nation,

what does ownership really mean?

I mean, I can claim anything I want.
I can claim to own Prospect Park

in Brooklyn, but just saying that I do or
even moving there

and living in Prospect Park wouldn't
entitle me to the rights that usually go

along with ownership,

unless someone with a bunch of power

agreed that I owned it and could enforce
that ownership and keep others

from claiming to also own it.
In the past,

explorers had few qualms about claiming to

own land,

even if other humans were already there,
because they had

power on their side - mainly plenty of guns,

Germs and Steel.
To paraphrase con artist

Canada Bill Jones, "you know what beats four aces?

A gun."
Or as @lawblob pointed out,

McDonald's actually does serve
breakfast after 10:30,

if you have a gun. If you claimed some
land on the Moon as your own and moved in,

would you also have to hire your own lunar police

and Cislunar military to defend it and
to keep others from

challenging your claim?
Pretty much.

That's kind of the problem.
Currently it is

risky for individuals or corporations to claim

and use extraterrestrial territory
because the Outer Space Treaty

says that outer space is the common

heritage of mankind.
It belongs

to all of us

and only to all of us.

Many interpretations of the Outer Space
Treaty predict that powerful things like

nations

would be reluctant to come to your
defense should someone else want to move in

or cause trouble

or dispute your extraterrestrial claim.

Maybe you could get the sovereign nation
to weigh in on your behalf by declaring

universal jurisdiction

but that would need to be for an
incredibly terrible heinous crime, a

crime against all of humanity, not just

a dispute over a few space rocks.

Catherine Doldirina from the
Institute of Air & Space Law at

McGill University suggests

that considering outer space, the common heritage of

mankind, has slowed space exploration.

You see, the Outer Space Treaty was based
on the Antarctic Treaty, which says that

the entire continent

shall never become the scene or object
of international discord.

Discord is not a good thing, but
without an incentive to profit from it,

not much has happened there,
as opposed to the

Arctic, where a resource boom is
currently underway.

If people felt safer appropriating and
taking advantage of space, of celestial

bodies,

if technological development was more incentivized,

would we already have orbiting tourist attractions

and lunar hotels?
Maybe.

But here is what you can currently own

in outer space: stuff you put there

and, to a certain extent, orbits.

The Outer Space Treaty says that the
stuff we left on the move,

anything put into space, remains property

of the original owner forever.
Orbits around

earth are temporarily granted by the
International Telecommunication Union,

a UN agency;
but they don't work like typical real estate

on Earth.
When a group of Equatorial nations

attempted to claim orbits above their
land boundaries, without planning on

putting satellites there,

their claim was largely ignored.

So you not only need to ask the UN for an orbit

and get permission,
you also need to use it and fill it.

It's a little disappointing that we
don't know how

lunar real estate works or if it will,

but it's exciting to know that we,
within our lifetimes,

might have a chance to be part of the solution.

A unique generation not visiting space
for the first time,

but homesteading it for the first time.

Here's another unresolved space law quandary.

If an alien landed in your backyard,

intelligent life from beyond Earth, and you shot it

with a gun, dressed it and then cooked up,
you and your family, some alien meat

fajitas, would that be

hunting or murder?

We literally don't know.
On earth, we have human rights,

but there are no alien rights.

Maybe it would fall under the category of

cultural vandalism, an act that's not necessarily

a legal, but is a giant bummer

to the rest of humanity.
This has happened before -

not with aliens - but with paintings.

In 2003, the Chapman brothers purchased
one of the few remaining sets of

Goya's Fantastic Disasters of War.

Instead of displaying the works for the
public, they defaced them

by drawing clown and puppy heads on the people.

They called the work "insult to injury."

In protest, a man threw red paint on
Jake Chapman when he appeared at Modern Art

Oxford,

but at the end of the day,
what the Chapman brothers did

wasn't illegal.
They owned the paintings.

Vandalizing the Moon or

killing a peaceful alien aren't illegal

acts, but just like defacing historical
paintings, they seem wrong on some

deeper level, especially since because in
most museums

you usually can't even touch the paintings.

But who was the first person

to touch the Moon with their bare hands?

I mean, the guys who walked around on the
Moon wore space suits, they had material

in between their skin

and the Moon.
Well, to be sure,

you already have the Moon in your hands.

Well, little Moons.
Lunula.

The crescent-shaped area at the base of
your fingernail,

where tissue is thicker and the red
vascular structures underneath are more

hidden,

making it white.
And to be even more sure,

at the quantum level touch is
problematic. As I've covered before,

atomically speaking, matter never really contacts

other matter in the conventional sense.
You can't

truly touch anything.
MinutePhysics called it

interaction over a short distance.

With that in mind, NASA says the

Terry Slezak was the first person to
touch the Moon

with his bare hands. He was a technician
in quarantine, who accidentally got lunar

soil smeared

all over his hand while removing film magazines

from the astronauts' cameras.
But when Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the

lunar module

after their moonwalk and removed their
helmets, they came into contact with

lunar dust

they tracked in on their suits.
They even reported its

odor, saying it smelled of spent gunpowder

or ashes, possibly because it oxidized

on contact with the air in the cabin.
Point is,

the first few breaths of Moon dusty

air that Armstrong and Aldrin took in were our first

fleshly contact with the Moon.

Or were they?
Walking around on earth

every day I am surrounded by material that recently

was in outer space. Hundreds of metric
tons of extraterrestrial rock falls to

Earth every year.
Some from the Moon, but most from asteroids,

ejected by a high-speed impact and
eventually caught by

Earth's gravity.
Some pieces are big enough to see,

but most are pulverized by our atmosphere
during entry into tiny particles that

disperse

in the air, becoming a tiny fraction of the very

dust and dirt we clean up and breathe in every day.

There's microscopic space dust,

pieces of asteroids and even the Moon all around us.

In fact, there might be microscopic
pieces of the Moon

under your bed right now or even

under your fingernails. Which means the
first human to have fleshly contact

with lunar material

was the first Homo Sapien hundreds of
thousands of years ago

to walk on dirt. We are still studying
exactly how much cosmic dust is in the

air that we breathe every day,

but it's safe to say that every once in
a while you inhale some

material that was recently in

outer space, some of which thousands of
years ago was on the Moon.

Was the Moon. And just like other
particulates in our atmosphere,

large enough pieces get trapped in the
mucus that protects

our lungs, meaning that picking your nose is gross,

but every once in a while,
a booger could literally

be out of this world.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
