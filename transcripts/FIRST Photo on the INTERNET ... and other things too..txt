Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And this week I am

in San Francisco. I just flew in a couple
of days ago, so I've been busy traveling,

but new episodes of
regular shows like IMG! and DONG are

coming soon. But in the meantime rather than
post nothing I figured I would share

things that have been on my mind.
For instance, go back to the Golden Gate

Bridge

footage. There. Her. 
That's the girl I sat next to on the flight.

Turns out she's an immunology researcher
at a university in Italy.

She's studying these parasitic worms in
Africa that that infect people,

but then leave those people immune
to things like diabetes

and allergies. In fact, if you cure these
people of the worm infection

they once again become susceptible to
things like diabetes and allergies.

It's really incredible, so, I guess,
good luck girl on the plane to solving that

because it sounds

awesome. On the flight I also did a bunch
of reading. I read this entire book.

The history of Britain in really tiny
little bite-sized chunks.

Now, the thing that really blew my mind
was about Ireland

and the potato famine in the 1840s.
So many people

died or left the country because at
that famine

that to this day the population of Ireland is still

lower than it was a hundred and fifty
years ago

before the famine.
Speaking of things like people and birth rates,

Breathingearth[.net] is an amazing website.
You can just sit there

and let the site visually show you,
based on recent statistics, where people are

being born

and dying and how frequently.
A blue Sun represents a birth

and a black dot represents a death.

This is a picture of Anne Hathaway.
So is

this.
Except this Anne Hathaway is much, much older

and she's also quite famous.
This Anne Hathaway was the wife

of William Shakespeare.
Now, we don't have a photograph of her because

photography as we know it today wasn't even
invented until two hundred years after

that Anne Hathaway died.
This is the first

permanent photograph ever taken by
mankind. It's a view from a window in

France taken in

1836.
Two years later,

in 1838, this photograph was taken.

And what's significant about it is that
it's the first photograph

ever taken that had people people in it.
If you look down here, for instance, you can see a man

at a water pump.

Modern colorization of the image have
also claimed to have discovered

other people in the picture.
Now, none of them are very clear,

which is why we should talk about Robert Cornelius.

I actually hid this portrait in the
beginning of

the most recent IMG!
And the reason it's significant is that this

picture is the first portrait ever taken.

It's the first capturing of light
reflected off a human's face.

Think of it this way: there is no other photograph

of anybody older than this.
This is the oldest human

we have a photographic record of.
Finally,

here's a picture that IMG!
would be proud of. A photo

of a musical parody group
called "The Horrible CERN Girls,"

formed out of employees at CERN.
The initials of their name in French are C, E,

R, N.
But why should we care about this picture?

Well, in 1992, Tim Berners-Lee

uploaded this photo to a website, making

this image the very first photographic image

ever on the Internet.
But here

is something that has never happened.
Along the border of

China and Bhutan is a mountain called
Gangkhar Puensum.

At 24,800 feet high it is the
tallest mountain in the world

that mankind has yet to reach the top of.

The local government prohibits not
nearing in the region, which means it

might be left unconquered for quite some
time, making it one of just

many things on Earth
that we have yet to explore.

In a couple of days we'll have a new episode of
DONG, so be sure to subscribe to Vsauce.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
