six days ago LittleBigPlanet 456 asked

for more online scary flash games so

because these sauce delivers I'm going

to do that right now along with some

funny and just straight-up creative

games they're all free and they're all

online and links to them are in the

description first the funny ones the

only point of this game is to make Harry

Potter and Hermione kiss before Ron

Malfoy or Dumbledore can catch them but

hey how about avoiding pop-ups that is

all you do in this game and as such it

is called

the realistic Internet simulator I don't

even know is hilarious each mission is a

completely new ungrammatical lolspeak

challenge click in Steve easy here we go

it's a wait it could stop it stop just

okay got it god I've got him but now a

couple scary games this point and click

game is based on Alice in Wonderland you

have to use and find items and trippy

ways to find your way out the only

problem is alice is dead something about

the art style in this game freaks me out

but really all you have to do is find

and click the play button

it gets pretty creative and weird

speaking of which let's cover some

creative games here you don't shoot

missiles you are a missile you move your

mouse to steer yourself an aim through

slots it's pretty disorienting but not

as much as the disorientation game where

the level warp skews and twists making

you dizzy and making it difficult to

move yourself around even with something

as simple as the arrow keys draw play is

my favorite type of game you get to

control your character with the arrow

keys and then draw the level yourself

avoid spikes and get creative with how

you draw yourself away from danger you

can even do it like this alright now

here's a game I played last night for

longer than I really care to admit in

this game you get a number of

territories and you can attack enemy

territories and claim them if your zone

has the same number of dice or more on

it than the one you're attacking when

you attack both zones have to roll their

die and if you have the highest sum you

win here's a game that looks just like

the perspective illusions I've shown I

and

you have to move your mouse to look

around until you're looking from the one

angle where the 3d cloud of floating

dots magically aligned to form what

looks like a flat 2d image now if your

brain needs a break and it wants funny

stuff here's a game where do you have to

be secret with your farts standing at a

bus stop

let gas escape but only when loud cars

drive by if other people catch wind of

your wind you're busted but if you don't

fart enough the gas builds up and your

body explodes just like in real life but

it gets worse here's a Japanese game

where you poke butts and avoid poop

which is a pretty good place to wrap

things up I love doing videos off of

your recommendations so if you have any

ideas about vsauce or vsauce to videos
