vsauce michael here coming by a webcam

in Kansas I'm headed back to NYC

tomorrow but I wanted to send you 10

quick vsauce video game WTF i was

inspired by a CJ 2010's comment about

some snow humpers and doodle jump I

couldn't find video confirming this but

Vsauce keep your eyes open moving on the

proper way to decorate a Christmas tree

or if it's too violent for you here's a

cute secret pet in hell's highway just

kidding it's a weapon

you can [ __ ] it and shoot lasers out of

its face or if you prefer check out this

custom map from Team Fortress 2 where

you fight against laser cats well just

one giant laser cannon

but oblivion might have an even creepier

creature a Flying Spaghetti Monster that

gets angry and anger is only matched by

these riot shields a more graceful

movement can be found in this early

Cataclysm glitch where minions succubi

could use whiplash to fling people to

stomach-turning heights to make up for

that long fall here's video of an

incredible lease ad nude patch for Wow

oh and if you put the second player in a

bubble for an entire new Super Mario

Brothers we level and hit a when you

reach the flagpole you win but disappear

and nothing happens ever I think this is

what hell will be like but this has got

to be heaven develop earth Rex is

working on a connect sex game where you

can air fondle girls all the demo videos

have been removed from YouTube and

Microsoft says it will never leave the

game but here's something that does

exist

click the boat to watch a new show on

vsauce2 called boat it's where you guys

get to decide the best of all time this

week flash mobs
