video game reviews a lot of people

commented on the fact that Jerry bloob

has a pillow underneath his sweatshirt

medical condition that leaves his

nipples razor-sharp so it pierces

through his t-shirts like this so in

order to protect his sweatshirt from his

razor-sharp nipples he has to wear the

pillow here's the July episode of

uninformed video game reviews enjoy

Jerry Blue pier with uninformed video

game reviews the show where I review

games I've never played before

because Game Stop doesn't take food

stamps today is July now that summer is

in full swing it's important to stay

cool how do you do that no problem all

you need is a giant fan turn that up to

full blast mode a huge pitcher of water

and you got yourself a indoor sprinkler

my pants are full of so much water Ecco

the Dolphin could swim in them now that

I'm kind of dry let's start the reviews

the first game this month is Metal Gear

Solid Peace Walker for Sony's PCP its

latest stealth action game from creator

Hideo Konami but instead of killing guys

the snakes peaceful this time so he just

hugs them and not creepy hugs like from

my cross-dressing uncle Larry but nice

hugs like from my cross-dressing aunt

Larry I give this game an A plus plus

plus plus next up is Alpha Protocol for

the Sony 3 and the icebox 360 alpha

alpha alfalfa this game by Sega is about

alfalfa from The Little Rascals he has

an escaped hospital to fight the evil

Spanky in a pickle eating contest I beat

myself in a pickle eating contest I ate

seven jars also new this month

crackdown 2 which is exclusive for the

ice box crackdown 2 is like if Grand

Theft Auto and halo had a baby and there

was crack so it's about a crack baby

it's about a lonely lonely lonely crack

baby I give this game a for her ever

good the final game of the month is

Dragon Quest 9 for the Nintendo DS its

ninth one in the series so everybody

knows a story by now you play as Goku

who gets hatched from an egg and he has

to dye his hair blond so that he can

defeat his arch-nemesis vagina it's

really popular in the state of Japan and

I like it too I give it 10 stars all

right this is the part of the show

called game life is real life or I try

something out from a video game to see

gonna try something from Metal Gear

Solid and that game snake eats rations

when he's hungry and then he doesn't

feel bad anymore so since my stomach

hurts let's try eating some rations

delicious rations
