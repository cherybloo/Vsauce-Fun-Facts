Vsauce fate Games presents Facebook the

game did you guys like something like

that we'll pop in the cartridge and

explore a hundred and fifty million

profiles avoid the dangerous murderous

pokes do that anymore choose a weapon to

ignore messages from that sweaty kid who

kept trying to hold your hand in third

grade or take a break and procrastinate

by looking at your female friends

pictures bullseye

earn feats of strength in the dungeon

levels ignore your mother's friend

request and beat the clock untagging

yourself from photos that make you look

fat oh how the H do I get out of here

you'll have to morph into the only thing

that can escape Facebook private

personal data

nice problem-solving collect power-ups

to earn the maximum of 5,000 friends and

avoid the spinning death blades of

unneeded event invites come on I don't

even live in Kansas anymore

Oh see a messed up now where are we I

think we're stuck in Friendster wait

even worse

we're in myspace Facebook the game

playing so big thanks to him if you guys
