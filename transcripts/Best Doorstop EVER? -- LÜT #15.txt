A tentacle dress and cheeseburgers flip flops.
It's episode 15

of LÜT.

Keep your doors open with NeatoShop's
gross gutsy zombie

doorstop.
Or be a superhero with these hoodies.

Look how serious he is.
Keep your dog warm with this scarf.

I mean, let's talk about the Millennium
Falcon. Or a Star Wars flight jacket from

adidas.

Studio Swine makes these glasses.
They're just

artwork for now, but are made out of
human hair. A strange, but renewable

resource.

These sticking peel stickers let you give
your electrical sockets fun

faces and Arlyn emailed me this Rubik's Cube

for the blind. You can also pick up a
stack of Rubik's Cube colored sticky

notes or

these notes that are reminders and Tetris.

ShanaLogic provides awesome things.
Currently

they're sold out of these earrings,
but have plenty of kitty tied to a balloon

necklaces. But if you wanna know the
animal on your necklace,

Uncommon Goods will send you a mould to
stick on your pet and send back.

Then they'll make you a custom necklace
in the shape

of your dog's nose.
Japan Trend Shop carries these samurai

underpants authentically designed after
the style of famous historical

warriors. And Peter Bristol makes this
informative dresser

that removes all confusion, while Miriam
Liebana has designed sperm shaped

cutlery

that brings meals to life.
Speaking of manly,

floss your power with this tactical
grilling apron and a handmade ring

scale replica

of a .44 caliber chamber.
For 10 bucks you could split your music with his

branch between your friend and your other friend.

And for 80 bucks you can deconstruct the
lamp into its constituent

pieces. The cord itself wraps around
to produce

the lamp shade. Keep acting smart with a
working feather pen and quill set,

then go against the flow and watch a 3D movie

in 2D.
These glasses from ThinkGeek

isolate one layer of a 3D movie and give you a nice

flat picture. Your free thing this week
comes from "guardianjuan" who recommends

HardlyWork.in,

a site that can adapt your
Facebook into what looks like a

spreadsheet.

Now you can waste time at work
and look like the hardest-working

employee. Perfect.
Back in Kansas I found some great

confusing fireworks. The poopy puppy
actually makes a flaming

bowel movement and this depressed
middle-aged man? Well, he's part of the

500 grams of

black powder baby boomer explosive.
Almost as cool

is Blonde Joke, an explosive covered in

blonde women. Yeah, I don't know either.
But what I do know

is that you should subscribe to
Vsauce for more LÜT.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
