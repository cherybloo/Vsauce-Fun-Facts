(In Mario voice) Hey it's me, Mario!

Let's eat a mushroom!

Mmm, delicious, delicious.

Oh no, it's making my stomach all grumbly.

This mushroom is gonna give me the poo-poo's.

(Farting noise)

Oh I'm farting, no one can touch me, I smell
so bad it kills all the bad guys, but I cannot

stop running.

Weeeeeee.

Oh, I'm making the water dirty.

Hey there's Bowser.

No!

Don't put the fire on the fart!
