hey everyone I'm Lacy and this is BTW on

bauce this week I talking about online

gaming specifically the people that you

meet online you know exactly who I'm

talking about they're the people that

are always there and they always annoy

you and yet they never go away first

there is the young gamer this is the

gamer that should have been in bed about

20 minutes ago and yet here they are

still up gaming with you you know how

carnival rides have those rides that you

have to be certain to be on well how

about we have gaming that you have to

have voices that are like this low to

game that will eliminate them

completely next you have the guy that

lives in his mom's basement let's face

it they're still out there I know free

rent is awesome but there's times that

you just need to get out just get out

then there's the guy that makes fun of

everybody's gamertags this guy no matter

what your Gamertag is he will find

something wrong with it and what I have

to say to you sir is if your gamer tag

is pone Master 69 you should not be

criticizing anybody else's gamertag next

we have the guy that hosts games even

though his connection sucks this guy

shouldn't be hosting games and yet he is

so you end up either on the ground in

the corner you can't hear your partners

you end up getting killed or dropping

dead even though you're not

dead so next we have the guy that places

music over his headphones now this guy

is one of my favorites because you know

what when when I come into a Lobby I

want to hear your music no really if you

have are angsty and you're listening to

Eminem I Love Eminem I'm just going to

pop open a smear off ice and start

chugging with you because I know that's

probably what you're drinking if you're

blasting Eminem in a Lobby of a game

okay so next we have the person that

uses cheap weapons to win

battles this guy thinks that the grenade

launcher or the rocket launcher is his

best friend or that the Ghost in Halo is

something that he should constantly be

riding the whole entire game just

because you're getting more kills

doesn't mean you're a better player it

just means that you're just ruining

everybody else's

gameplay and finally here's one that

really hits home for me guys that hit on

girl gamers I I I know I made a mistake

in putting girl in my gamertag but it

doesn't mean I want you to talk to me

why don't you just save your energy to

beat me in the game right I'll gladly

talk to you if you can beat

me well that's all I have for you this

week BTW those really really obnoxious

Gamers you could always just mute

them
