every geek's dream and a great reason to

keep driving your car it's episode 21 of

IMG here's a picture of Darth Prime and

here's Barbie as a homicidal

sociopath not terrible enough for you

then check out this example of bad

parenting what's this kid freaking out

about uh well here's a trick to make you

look buffer and here are sad drawings of

Kirby some are trippy some are ghosts

and some are violent but some just

aren't even the right color these books

with Pages fold to to spell words were

cool a couple weeks ago but this shelf

of books tells us more but if you prefer

emoticons Kira ratbone uses typewriters

to print symbols onto paper to make

elaborate works of art now chances are

you're using your eyes to see these

images but up close your eyes look like

sand Dooms your iris is a freaky

structure made of fibers and cells

attached to muscle so use them to

witness the most confusingly badass

birthday cake ever or if you don't have

a sweet tooth try this pizza topped with

pizzas topped with more pizzas now funny
