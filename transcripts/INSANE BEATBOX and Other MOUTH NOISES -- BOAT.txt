Here's a guy whose mouth can sound like
an engine.

And this woman can be a human

car alarm.

But are those the best mouth noises

of all-time?
And better yet, what happened to my beard?

Well, to figure out the answer to this one,
you'll have to wait for 'The Key of Awesome's'

new music video on Thursday.

But don't let it distract you, ladies.
Let's focus on the mouth

and mouth noises and the best of all time.
All aboard the boat.

Here's an old man who can do a monkey and

a horse.
On the aquatic side, here's

a dolphin woman.

This guy can mimic the sound of a pistol reloading.

And if you want something wetter,

this kid opens and pours a can of coke.

When things get awkward, call over Fletcher901

who can give you some great cricket
noises to fill the silence.

Competitive whistelers

are incredible.

One of the neatest

whistle tricks I've seen is the ability
to whistle through two or more

openings in your mouth, so you can make
multiple tones and harmonize

with yourself.

Of course, beat boxers are some of the most famous
noisemakers on YouTube.

Some newer clips

show beat boxers during dub step sounds,
like Reeps One.

Links, by the way, to all these noises are in 
the description below.

Also worth a listen is Mastamicbeatbox.

And Slizzer.

I mean, look how much fun this guy's having.
While you're jamming to that, I wanna

invite you into my own little

experiment. On Thursday, the next Vsauce video
on this channel will come out at

exactly

6 p.m. Eastern.
The first 100 people to get there and comment the word

"Boooyerz" will get a YouTube message specially

from me.
So you have to be there right at 6 p.m.

Let's see what happens.

And as always,

thanks for watching.
