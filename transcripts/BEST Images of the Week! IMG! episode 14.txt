steampunk R2-D2 and this Kitty says

thumbs up it's episode 14 of

[Music]

IMG it's hard to be a Lego gangster but

it's easy to kill two birds with one

stone check out these minimalist

superheroes can you name them all the

same guy who made these also made the

peanuts as peanuts and Boba font which

is a great segue because in our last

video I asked you about your favorite

emoticons and you guys had great ones

emoticons can also be used to explain

plastic surgery before after before

after before after and so on did you

miss gar this year luckily Kotaku put

together a collection of great pictures

from the event and not just pictures of

grandpas the whole thing was so much it

gave this guy a giant joystick Let It

Snow such a festive decoration but if

you move these two letters to the middle

it gets a little more forceful let it

now but let's talk Thanksgiving Epic

Meal Time made a YouTube video about

making this what they call the turbacon

Epic as they describe it it's a quail

cooked inside a Cornish hen inside a

chicken inside a duck inside a turkey

inside a pig all covered in bacon served

with a sight of cheeseburgers and if

that's a little too intense for you

maybe this coloring book polar bears in

a snowstorm from the Toronto Zoo is more

your style you get to color polar bears

in snowstorms so all it comes with is

five white crayons Pokey love I Choose

You and Azeroth made out of Magic the

Gathering cards interested in trolling

the high seas buy this it's a working

boat that always looks like it's

capsizing you on the other hand will

look awesome gift break a little digital

fiddling can turn horror into a cardio

workout and this gift beats just like a

heart a giant chronological Batman actor

heart b.ca collected a treasury of the

best people who shop at Walmart some are

cute matching couples some have hot buns

or t

some are Jennifer Garner and some

luckily are just plain old normal dang

it there's nothing scarier than that

except maybe ninja strippers so on that

note let me know in the comments below
