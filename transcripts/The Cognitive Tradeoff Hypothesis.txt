This is Inuyama, Japan,

a historic city

home to Japan's oldest
original wooden castle.

It is also home
to Kyoto University's

Primate Research Institute.

 Here, a group of chimpanzees
 have been trained

 to play a game that exposes
 something shocking

 about their memories.

 This is going
 to blow your mind.

 Here is how it works.

 Take a look at these numbers.

 1, 2, 3.

 Remember where they are,

 because they're about
 to disappear.

 Can you point to where
 each number used to be

 in numerical order?

 Probably. It's pretty easy.

 1, 2, 3.

 But what if we
 make it harder?

 Get ready to point to where
 each number was in order...

 now.

 If you feel like you didn't
 have enough time

 to memorize the screen,
 that's fine.

 It's nothing
 to be ashamed of.

 Or is it?

 Here is a chimpanzee
 taking exactly that long

 to memorize the same
 arrangement.

 Nailed it.

 Each of these puzzles
 is completely new

 to the chimpanzee,

 but just a glance
 is all it needs

 to completely capture
 all the numbers.

 How can a chimpanzee's memory

 be so much better
 than ours?

 Well, one theory
 is that we humans

 are worse at this task
 because we can talk.

What makes humans different
from other animals?

Well, one thing is language.

We have the cognitive ability

to communicate not just about
what's happening now,

but also about what did happen,
and what could happen.

We can tell stories,
and it's awesome.

But if language is so good,

why didn't any other animal
develop it like we did?

 A good approach
 to this question

 is one that looks
 at how we are different

 from those who were almost us.

 Around 7 million years ago,

 there were no chimpanzees
 and there were no humans.

 But there were CHLCAs,

 an acronym which stands for

 "Chimpanzee-Human
 Last Common Ancestor."

 Like us,
 CHLCAs didn't have

 great natural offenses
 or defenses,

 protective shells or claws,
 fangs or venom.

 So living in the safety
 of the trees was great.

 Those who stayed became
 the chimps we know today.

 But for reasons we're still
 not quite sure of,

 some of the CHLCAs decided
to venture down to the savanna.

 Without appropriate
 physical abilities,

 things like cooperation,
 imagining new strategies,

 and the assigning of roles
 were necessary for survival,

 all of which are easier
 if you have

 a rich collection of symbols

 that can refer to things
 across time:

 language.

 Many different types
 of creatures emerged

 with varying adaptations.

 But today, only one member
 of the family remains.

 Us.

Language as we know it may have
been one of the strategies

that kept us alive
in the savanna.

But where did it move in?

The brains of those
who developed language

and those who didn't
aren't totally different.

A brand-new brain structure
didn't just pop into existence.

Instead, anatomy used
for other tasks

must have been sacrificed.

And as it turns out,
for beautiful reasons,

detailed short-term memory

may have been
a fair thing to lose

in return for language.

This trade-off
between memory and language

is the Cognitive Tradeoff
Hypothesis.

 The Cognitive Tradeoff
 Hypothesis

 is the culmination
 of decades of work

 by one of the world's leading
 primatologists,

 Professor Tetsuro Matsuzawa

 of Kyoto University's
 Primate Research Institute.

 Founded in 1967,

 the institute was created
 for scientific research

 in association with the nearby
 Japan Monkey Center.

The collaborative centers house
 over 60 species

 and nearly 1,000 primates who
 live and play in open spaces.

Look at monkeys.

[monkeys chitter]

Is there a baby
on that one?

-[Michael] Six months?
-[Tetsuro] Yes.

[gibbers]

That's where they live.

[Michael]
Can you do it?

[grunts]

 Dr. Matsuzawa has spent
 over 40 years

 researching
 non-human primates.

 He splits his time
 between fieldwork

 in the West African country
 of Guinea,

 and here in Japan,

 where he and his colleagues
 have developed

 a chimpanzee habitat

 designed to mimic life
 in the wild.

This habitat is home to Skylab,
 a working laboratory

 set high atop the chimpanzee''
 climbing structure.

 In this open air lab,

 chimpanzees are free
 to come and go as they please.

And this is how you move?

 If they decide to stay,

 they participate
 in cognitively enriching tasks

 designed to mimic
 foraging behavior.

 When the chimpanzees are
 interested in participating,

 they enter one of Skylab's

 specially designed
 computer booths,

 where a camera uses
 facial recognition software

 to recognize them
 and select a test

 based that particular chimp's
 current familiarity

 with the task.

 Each trial takes about as long

 as it would for a chimp
 to forage a single bite.

 And each morsel
 of food they get

 is accounted for
 in their diet.

Do the doors open
when they approach?

No human even needs to be...?

 So, what is for us
 a great way to collect data,

 is for them an experience

 similar in many ways

 to what they would be doing
 in the wild.

Impressive.

 Dr. Matsuzawa has been running
 memory tests like these

 on chimpanzees since 1978.

 His research has shown
 the phenomenal

 and nearly photographic
 short-term memory

 of these primates.

 Two of the most famous chimps
 at the PRI are Ai,

 named after the Japanese word
 for "love,"

 and her son Ayumu,
 whose name means "walk."

 What can we learn
 about ourselves

 by studying chimpanzees
 like them?

 Well, I want to find out.

If we and chimpanzees
come from a common ancestor,

what can explain the split
where the chimpanzees

don't seem to need
or to develop language

like we did?

Why would that happen?
Was it an accident?

Ah-ha.

Our habitat...

provided a pressure
to develop language.

Yes.

-That's incredible.
-Mm.

So, in a way, we should be
really grateful

that our ancestors
were so weak,

they got pushed
out of the trees.

[thumping]

-Bang, bang.
-[laughs]

[Michael] I'd invite you to be
a part of this interview,

but you don't have language.

Right now.

Mm-hmm.

Quick decisions.

Our ancestors didn't have
that same pressure?

Hmm.

[Michael] The Cognitive
 Tradeoff Hypothesis

 suggests that in the dangerous
 world beyond the trees,

 early humans needed
 to teach each other

 and use abstract symbols
 that could refer

 not just to the immediate
 here and now,

 but to hypotheticals
 and generalities.

 Making room for that kind
 of abstract thinking

meant sacrificing the immediate
 and detailed memory

 of their ancestors.

Yeah.

I'm able to imagine
past and future.

I'm able to describe things
in an abstract way.

And I don't need the details,

because I have the label.

So it seems like a pretty good
trade-off.

Yeah.

Yeah.

What a great message, right?

Sharing is what makes us "us."

I would love to see your
working memory tests

on chimpanzees in action.

I would also really love
to participate myself

and see how well I can do
compared to a chimpanzee.

Yes.

Have you ever had
a human and a chimpanzee

compete like that
together?

-[hooting]
-[Michael] They're excited

-about the idea too.
-[laughs]

[gibbering]

[Michael]
An opportunity to do the memory
 task just like a chimpanzee

 is really special.

 Who knows how it will go?

 Let's see who shows up.

-[clapping]
-[Michael] Yeah!

You're really good
at this, Ai.

 Looks like today,
it will be celebrity chimp, Ai.

 Ai is older now,
 and just like in humans,

 her cognitive abilities
 have decreased with time.

 So I may actually
 stand a chance.

 To face off against Ai,

 I will be sitting in the booth
 next to her.

 Normally, her son Ayumu
 plays against her.

 But today, well,
she's in for some Michael time.

I'm not your child, though,
am I?

 The tests are going
 to get harder as we go along.

 How will my memory compare
 to that of a chimp

 who never made
 the same cognitive trade-off?

[exhales]

 In the first round,
 the task is to remember

where each of the three numbers
 are in numerical order.

 But here's the trick:

 as soon as I touch
 one of them on the screen,

 the other two will
 be covered by solid squares,

 so I can no longer see
 where they are.

 Now, well,
 it's up to my memory.

[Tetsuro]
Okay, let's go.

[Michael]
 If I make a mistake,

 I get an error noise
 like this...

[buzzer]

 ...while a correct answer

 sounds like this.

[computer chirps]

 When the chimpanzee
 gets it right,

 they are rewarded
 with apples.

 The human, me, well,
 just gets the bragging rights.

I'm not getting apples.

[laughs]

[computer chirps]

You really actually have
to focus more than I expected.

Almost messed that one up.

[buzzer]

[computer chirps]

[Tetsuro]

How did Michael do?

95.

[Michael]
 On my first run,

 I've managed to beat Ai.

What is the next task?

How many symbols?

Whoa.

[computer chirps]

This is a lot harder.

 This game is similar
 to the last,

 but starts a little bit
 differently.

 This time, three numbers
 appear on a blank screen,

 but as soon as I touch
 the first one,

 the entire screen
 is covered in boxes.

[computer chirps]

Whew.

[buzzer]

[computer chirps]

[buzzer]

[Michael]
Ai...

you having fun?

-Whoa!
-[grunts]

 Ai is used to Ayumu, her son,
 playing the game beside her,

 so my presence
 may be throwing her off.

I'm here for moral support, Ai.

 It was fun squaring off
 against Ai,

 but I want to see how I would
 do against her son, Ayumu.

I'm ready.

Okay...

[Michael] Ayumu is currently
 Matsuzawa's best pupil,

 able to ace the memory tests
 at blazingly fast speeds.

[computer chirps]

 But today, Ayumu is not
 interested in mental combat.

 He's busy flirting
 with some young ladies

 who live with him
 here at the PRI.

 And since free choice
 is the guiding principle

 of Matsuzawa's research,
 we can't make him join us.

 The good news is that
 Ayumu doesn't need to be here

 for me to compete
 against him.

 The game can be presented
 to me just as Ayumu does it:

 with nine numerals.

 Let's see if my luck
 is the same against Ayumu

 as it was against Ai.

Oh, man.

Okay.

-[buzzer]
-Wow.

[laughs]

Even when I take time
I can't do it right.

Okay, more time.

[buzzer]

I thought I had that one.

It takes a long time to memorize
nine numerals' positions.

[buzzer]

It's embarrassing
how long this takes me.

I can do this one.

[computer chirps]

All right.

Yeah.

You don't need
to laugh about it.

Thirteen.

I got better, yeah,
because you were pressuring me.

Jesus.

Six times worse,
six times slower.

Yeah. I would love to.

[Michael] This is the most
 difficult test.

 I have to remember all nine
 numbers in numerical order

 at Ayumu's speed,

 which is to say,
 I have to do

 what I could
 barely do before,

 but now I have
 to memorize them all

 within the amount of time

 it takes to blink.

So I get half a second
to prepare?

I'm going to prove you wrong.

 As a reminder,
 this is how Ayumu performs,

 which is standard
 for a young chimp.

You got to be kidding me.

-That's way too fast.
-[buzzer]

I got the first three.

[buzzer]

It's like a joke.

[buzzer]

[laughs]
I don't know where the 2 is.

[buzzer]

It's too fast.

Trying to think of this
very holistically.

[buzzer]

[clears throat]

[buzzer]

After the first three,

if I see them,
I'm just having to guess.

[laughs]

[buzzer]

Yeah. It's impossible.

Well, I hope this was
helpful for you.

It was the first time you had
had a chimpanzee and a human

together in the booth.

What do you think--?

[both laugh]

If you ever need me
to study as a primate,

-I give myself to you.
-Okay.

Wow.

And we need to make sure
to preserve them.

-They're already endangered.
-Yes.

And yet they are our closest
link to understanding

what we came from
and where we might go.

[Tetsuro]
Mm.

[Michael] It's like taking care
of your family.

-[Tetsuro] Mm, right.
-[Michael] Quite literally.

[Tetsuro]
Yes.

[snarling]

[Michael]
 The fact that humans alone

 use complex
 symbolic language

 doesn't make us any better
 than any other species.

 It just means that the path
 we took required it.

 In fact, in some ways
 we aren't better,

 because we can talk.

 Today, we study those
 who took different paths

 as a way to learn
 more about ourselves.

 If we lose them,
 we lose part of our story,

 where we came from,

 who we are,

 and who we can be
 in the future.

[gibbering]

[shrieks]

 And, as always,

 thanks for watching.

 This season,
 on Mind Field.

I will die.

But should I?

I want to perform
a reverse exorcism.

There was like
a glowing figure, man.

[man]

I would love to do the Stanford
prison experiment again.

There, let's blast them again.
Number three.

[electricity hums]

Have you ever had a human

and a chimpanzee compete
like that together?

You having fun?

-Whoa!
-No, not really.

[shrieks]

I am going to make
my hometown

function like a brain.

[cheering]

Doing a good moral deed can
actually make you more likely

to do something immoral.

We're going to see if we
can get people to allow a child

to take the blame
for a crime they committed.

-How old are you, son?
-Twelve.

[guard] We're going to need
to talk to the police.

This facility is where you both
cryo-preserve people

and store them.

We have 159 patients
in these tanks.

We're offering an unknown
extension of human lifespan.

-[Michael] You spied
on their dream.
-Yeah.

That's pretty spooky.

[Michael] We received a message
from outer space.

Please figure out
what this message is saying.

-[man] You ready?
-I'm ready.

Hey, I have to leave
and go over to the next episode,

but you can come with me.

the next episode of Mind Field.

I'll see you there.
