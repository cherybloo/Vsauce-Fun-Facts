Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
And I'm Regent's Park

in London joined by Tom from "/Tom."

Awesome channel, check it out.
This camera belongs to Tom and Hazel

is operating it right now.
Yeah, that's her giving a thumbs up, which

I'm sure just look like a blur,
but the point is we're gonna do information today.

Right now, Tom, I'm in London.
Which is in England. And it's also in

the United Kingdom.
Which is in Europe. Okay, and we've also

got another term - Great Britain.
Well, let's unpack all these terms

and today learn about

geography.
I may have failed geography.

Can I find someone else?

Now, if we're going to talk about
geography, I think we should go all the

way back to a time

when there was no geography. That's right.
Way before YouTube existed,

our solar system was nothing but a
mist of dust and gases,

what is known as a solar nebula.
But then,

about 4.6 billion years ago something

majestic happened.
We don't know exactly what caused it,

but some scientists believe that the
shockwave of a nearby supernova

hit our nebula, causing it to start spinning

and contracting. Now, as things collected
together, their overall gravity got

stronger and they pulled more stuff in it.
And boom,

we've got a Sun.
A half billion years later,

and the disk of junk circling around
the Sun starts coming together in its

own way,

into what we now call the planets.
One of these planets I've actually

visited and it's called Earth.
But before we get ahead of ourselves,

what the heck is the Moon doing there?
I mean, here's the problem. When you look at

all the terrestrial planets,
all the planets near us, near the Sun,

they all have very similar structure and
they'll have the same big metal core

and they all have very similar densities.
But the Moon

is very not dense.
And it doesn't have

a similar structure, it doesn't have a huge
dense metal core.

In fact when we visited them and brought
back dust and rocks to analyze what the

Moon was made out of,

we found that the Moon was made out of
the same stuff that you find in

Earth's crust and mantle but not Earth's

core. This discovery gave rise to a
pretty awesome idea

that the moon is actually made out of
what used to be

on Earth.
About 4.52

billion years ago there used to be
another planet

called Theia. It was a little bit smaller
than Mars but it had an unfortunate

orbit. It was fine for millions of years
but eventually and

what did happen to it was that it
collided with Earth.

Now, it's believed that
the collision happened quite slowly

and the centers, the cores of both Theia and Earth

fused into one. And material from the
mantle and crust of Earth

wasn't just scattered
but it was forcefully ejected,

literally launched into outer space.
It circled around

Earth and scientists believe that it took
only about a week

for all that Earth material out in space
to coalesce

into what we now call the Moon.
Oh, and by the way, if

that's how the Moon formed,
it was such a strong collision

the actual axis that the Earth spun on was tilted

23.5 degrees, which to this day

is why we have seasons.well

Wow.

Alright, so four billion years ago the
continents as we know them

began to emerge. You know, these pieces of
the Earth's crust that have cooled down

and are floating around on Earth's molten
liquid insides.

Now, they move and they've been in
constant motion since they began but

they move

very, very slowly.
Every 300 to 500 million years,

the continents all converge into what's called one

big supercontinent.
All the land in the entire Earth

altogether and the rest of it covered in
ocean. The most recent supercontinent is

kind of a famous, it's called

Pangaea. But scientists believe that there
may have been four, five, six or even more

supercontinents that existed

before Pangaea.
What's really mind-blowing

is the fact that eventually there's
going to be another Pangaea, another supercontinent.

And based on calculations,
the Earth at that time

will look like this. But like I said,
these land masses are moving very very

slowly

and so for that reason it is worth
learning their names

as they are now.
Which brings us back to the question of

England, United Kingdom, Great Britain,

British Isles and what all these terms mean.
Let's begin

zoomed out.
The British Isles and Ireland are a collection of

6 thousand islands off the coast of Europe.
The term

Great Britain refers to the largest
of these islands.

Now, Great Britain contains three
separate countries: England,

Wales and Scotland.
If we add Northern Ireland into the mix,

we're now looking at what is known as
the United Kingdom or the

UK. The Republic of Ireland is a
separate country that is not part

of the United Kingdom. And, by the way,
England is where London is

which is where Summer in the City was.
Which brings us back to Regent's Park.

And

as

always,

thanks for

watching.

Could you guys stand still for a second?

To learn more about Great Britain,

Ireland, overseas territories and even Canada,

you really must check out CGPGrey's

explanation video, if you haven't seen it already.
This guy's incredible.

You can also check out the channels belonging to
the people who helped me with the intro

and outro for this video.
We've got Tom and
