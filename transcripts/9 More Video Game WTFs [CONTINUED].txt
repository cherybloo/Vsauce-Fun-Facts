do you remember game genie this is what

would happen if Mario had a magic

mushroom what I love about this is the

game genie codes themselves are

hilarious the codes is using our ze big

pop and I date in Conker's Bad Fur Day

you actually fight living poop diarrhea

it comes alive it's after you know it's

a freaking scary no it is the most scary

villain ever can you imagine if your

poop grows out of the toilet and they

wanted to attack you that's a coli that

did happen to me last week actually but

I had these weird tacos this WTF was

submitted to be sauce by the staff Sarge

and I couldn't be more thankful splinter

cell chaos theory

this guy has I don't know some sort of

broken spine or something and it looks

like he's this is the holy grail of

every dude's the fantasy I don't see

what's so weird about it I think it's

amazing if you've got more that you like

leave them in the comments because I

want to see more if you want daily video

game news and comedies subscribe here

exactly good point Andreea and if you're

a really cool person check us out on

Facebook one of my favorite things to do

is to explore kind of the weird glitchy

you're not supposed to access them they

haven't really been developed areas of

World of Warcraft the coolest one I just

found this yesterday's is the ability to

go underneath Orgrimmar and you jump off

of this fence you're not supposed to

jump off of and all of a sudden you fall

into this weird desert and the entire

city of Orgrimmar becomes invisible it's

so trippy it's like almost kind of a

cool place to go and hide and meditate
