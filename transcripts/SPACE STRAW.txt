Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.
Our atmosphere

is a thin vail of air, held to earth's surface

by gravity.
We live in it, we breathe it, we walk through it

every day; it contains all weather, but yet

it is almost nothing.
In fact,

if the earth was the size of an apple
our atmosphere from the ground all

the way to outer space

would only be about as thick

as the skin of an apple.
And because our atmosphere gets

thinner, exponentially as you go up,
90 percent of our atmospheres mass

at this scale could fit within a space
as thin as just a

third of an apple's skin.
But that shrimpy sliver of a peel

would still be thousands of times
thicker than you are tall.

We humans are itsy bitsy dots

strolling around in a skinny sky.

But that skinny sky does a lot.
Think about this.

What if I had a really awesome big straw

and I stuck one end in the ocean and the other end out

in space.
Would outer space be able to suck

all the water out?
We know that

naked exposed veneer vacuum of space

all non concealed gases in your body

would be violently farted and burped

out. Sucked out.

But sucking is not attractive.

Instead, sucking merely refers to a flow

from a region of higher pressure to a
region of lower pressure.

In other words, a vacuum cleaner in and
of itself does not

attract matter to itself.
Like I said in my video

with no title, if you were to turn on a vacuum cleaner

at sea level,
a region inside the cleaner becomes as

thin as air in Denver, Colorado.
External

air, which is at a greater pressure,
is then literally pushed

by its own greater pressure into the machine, bringing

dust and debris with it.
The point is,

the strength of the force pushing air
into a vacuum cleaner

can only be as strong as the pressure

of the surrounding air.
Here on earth,

using a vacuum cleaner or even a space straw,
that pressure is

atmospheric pressure.
At sea level about 15 pounds per square inch

or 65.4 Newton's.
That amount of force can

only push pure water up about 10.3 meters

or 33.9 feet.
Because outer space

is not 10 meters up,
it's more like 100,000 meters up,

a space straw would be a terrible
doomsday device for a super villain to

use to get rid of our oceans.

Our atmosphere just isn't heavy or strong enough

to push water into orbit.
Because the weight

of air above, pushing molecules below in
all directions is responsible for

air pressure, air lowered down exerts

more pressure. The air at your feet
pushes with a slightly greater force

than the

air at your head. Now, across the human
body, you can't tell the difference.

But if an object is light enough,
it can be affected by this difference,

which is why a helium balloon floats.

The air down here pushes a tiny bit more
strongly than the air up here,

and since the balloon is lighter than
the same volume of air, it's literally

pushed up

by the air more strongly than gravity pulls it down.

This upward force, caused by a surrounding fluid

or gas that counteracts an object's weight,

is known as buoyancy.
Now, here on the surface of the earth,

the buoyancy of air isn't enough to
cause humans to float away

or be lifted. But it exists.
In fact, in a perfect vacuum,

you would weigh about a fifth of pound
more than you do

right now.
Thanks air! Back to our balloon

friend.
He's not going to float up forever

in the outer space, escaping earth.
Eventually, as the atmosphere thins out,

and the baloon expands, it will

pop and fall back down to earth,
its helium spreading throughout the atmosphere.

So, besides rockets that we intentionally

launch off of Earth, does our atmosphere ever

lose anything?
Does earth ever lose anything?

Does Earth ever gain anything?

I mean, I used to be smaller, I used to be a little kid.

But all of the atoms and molecules in my
body right now simply came from things

that I

consumed.
Things that I ate or drank or breathed in.

When new kids are born, the earth doesn't get

heavier, because a new baby is just a rearrangement of

atoms and molecules that used to be inside its mother

or molecules that she ate, drank or breathed in,

all of which came from earth.
Everything's recycled,

so is the earth not gaining or losing mass?

Well to begin, earth does lose some stuff.

For instance, hydrogen and helium are a bit too light

to stick around because of earth's
gravity. They eventually fly out into

space or get picked off by solar wind

at the edge of our atmosphere,
which is why, as I've said before,

we are likely to one day run out

of helium. Pretty soon.

But the earth gains mass in some ways as well.
For instance,

every year it's been estimated that 10 to 20

million kilograms of space dust
and meteorite fragments fall to Earth,

making it heavier. Now, if you factor in
the energy that the earth radiates away,

which is equivalent to mass, as well as
the energy the earth gets from the Sun

and holds onto, for instance,
using its greenhouse gases,

in total it has been calculated that every

year earth becomes 50 million kilograms

lighter.
That might sound like a lot,

but it is only 0.00 0000 0000 0000

1 percent of Earth's total mass,

which means that for all intents and
purposes, the stuff that we are made of,

the atoms and molecules in our bodies,
the food that we eat, the water that we drink, our

best friends,

has all been here since the early days

of Earth, including the air that you are breathing

right now.
Remember that six trillion
kilograms of oxygen that all humans

inhale

every year? Well, each and every one of us,
individually contributes by breathing

about 8.5 million times per year.

Here's the thing about a breath.
Because molecules

are so frustratingly small, a single

little breath contains about 10 sextillion

molecules.
In a poetic

twist of symmetry, Earth's entire
atmosphere contains a volume of air

equal to about 10 sextillion

breaths.
The number of molecules in one breath

is equal to the number of breaths our
earth has to give us,

that is assuming, of course, that we never
exhaled anything and it never got renewed,

which it does.

And because our atmosphere gets circulated so quickly

and because we breathe so often and
because molecules are so small,

statistically speaking, our atmosphere

our skinny little peel of air is

crowded with molecules that we've all
had inside our bodies

and been breathing.

To make this really mind-blowing,
let's focus only

on carbon dioxide.
We don't just breathe it in

and then right back out again.
It's a waste product that comes from all over

our bodies.

And carbon dioxide is useful to plants, which

absorb it and then turn it into sugars.
It doesn't just inertly float around our

atmosphere

forever. Okay.
Well, it has been estimated

that it takes one breath

about 1 year to thoroughly mix
throughout the hemisphere's

of earth and about 10 years to
thoroughly mix within the troposphere

that we live in

and the stratosphere above.
Now, given that only 5 percent of what we

exhale is carbon dioxide and only 20 percent of that

came from metabolism within our brain,

even if we assume that 99.99999 percent

of all the  CO2 you have ever exhaled has
been trapped in the oceans or absorbed

by plants

and made into sugars, it is still
mathematically certain,

even if you were in a brand new place
you've never breathed in before,

that every breath you take contains at
least a few molecules that were once

inside your brain.
A few of them

may have been molecules that you used
five years ago to remember where you

left your keys.

A few of them may have been inside your brain

when you first fell in love.
And

a few of them, almost certainly, were inside the brain

of your mother while she was giving birth

to you.
So,

take a deep breath because our air is

crowded with history.
And keep breathing,

because within the next 10 years it is certain that

I will breathe in a few carbon dioxide molecules that are

inside your brain right now, as you listen to me say

that:

As always,

thanks for watching.
