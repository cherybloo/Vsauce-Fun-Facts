A bird house that looks like a
surveillance camera

and Mister Spock-topus.
It's episode 26

of LÃœT.
Now, here's a perfume designed to make you smell

like a book. And Generate offers a limited edition

life wall clock.
It's just like a normal clock,

except slowed down by a factor of 61,320.

Every number represents a year

and it's meant to go around once in
the average person's life.

Keep your head warm by making your own
knitted brain hat,

but if you prefer ears, put some ears

on your ears, or around your neck,

or on your finger, or how about a mouth?

In fact, just get a nose ring.
No, no, no.

A nose ring.
Fifty Shades of Grey

Learn them. Seriously.
Here's a poster delineating

fifty shades of grey.
And these plates are perfect for

finger food, because they are finger sized.

Now, if you're going to be making
sandwiches, use this crust cutter to turn

it into two

dolphins and a heart.
If it's too early for sandwiches,

simply be a cereal killer.
Tuxedo

ring, emoticon rings,  inflatable Cthulhu arm or

or this touching little number.
Two rings

that come attached at the middle.
You snap them apart, so that you and one

other person

have perfectly matching, unique two-of-a-kind rings.

Time moves under

this watch's face, crossing the red present line.

Now, you can't see the future and the past is gone,

faded away.
For lunch, carry your sandwiches

in disguise bags. And rock in a rocking
chair designed to generate electricity

while you rock ... paper, scissors

necklaces are cool and sausage neck
pillows are even better.

When you fall asleep, don't do it alone, with these sheets

which have a fake little dog on them to
keep you company. The goofy eyes on this

clock tell you the time.

The one on your left looks to be hour
and the other looks at the minute.

This gumball tastes like apple cobbler,

but it's just the desert in your TV dinner gumset.

These two are flavored like roast beef
and buttered corn.

And these envelopes are fruit-flavoured,
when you lick them to stick them.

Oh look, a bathroom mist designed to smell

like a baby's head. Here's a special
thermally insulated bag that's great for

transporting

wine, but it looks like a cheap paper bag.

And you can frighten people
when you sip from your cracked

mug, full of death wish coffee.

A special roast guaranteed to be the strongest

coffee you've ever tasted.
Both in terms of flavor

and caffeine content.

Your iPhone can snap into this little
guy to become your pet

and these urine sample bottles contain a delicious

yellow liquid candy. Quiet down the
baby with a pacifiers that puts a

mustache

under his nose. This straw building kit
allows you to make your own custom

straws for mixing and sharing drinks

and these straws give you a kissy face.
Of course, make sure you're fancy

and use these fine disposable paper cups.

Or use an R2-D2 mug or glasses

designed to express each one of the seven

deadly sins.
For instance, pride,

sloth,

gluttony, wrath.

Here's a company that will take two
photos of your head and use them to print

a 3D action figure head of your face.

The smallest size can be used on LEGO dudes.

Or look, just use this backpack that
turns into a basketball

hoop.
Or this goopy mud that changes color with your mood

and why roll your sushi when you could
pack up this device

and a have a sushi bazooka?
Here's a fun free thing.

Desktop Gremlins offers easy to build
templates for fun paper

creations - video game characters, books, movies.

He even made a special YouTube Space Lab

papercraft, because on September 13th

the winning experiments will be done in outer space

live, right here on YouTube.
Ok, finally,

let's get beard-y.
A beard for your Apple,

lavender beard conditioner, beard love buttons

and last, but not least, a beer/beard

cozy. Amazing, right?
Well, for more cool things you can actually own

I highly suggest watching Naomi Kyle's show Cheap

Cool Crazy. It's on IGN's channel START,
which is full of original programming

for nerds like us.
Oh and, and,

as always,

thanks for watching.
